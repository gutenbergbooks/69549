<h3>
<i>Chapter One</i>
</h3>

<p>
Little Martha Kenworthy, to use her own careless
expression, was "in bad with her dad," as usual.  But she was
not a girl to be disturbed by a trifle of that sort.  She had been
home only a few days from her college in the east for her
second summer holiday, and had been followed too closely by
official comments on her term's work.  The only explanation
she saw fit to give to her father on that subject was to the effect
that he should forget it.  Her mother had taken him aside and
said privately, firmly, and coaxingly:
</p>

<p>
"Now, Bob, I'm not going to have that child's life made
miserable by somebody else's brilliance.  It isn't Martha's fault
that she hasn't phenomenal brains.  I'm not going to have her
scolded for being like me."
</p>

<p>
"Miserable!  Huh!  There's a fat chance of her being miserable.
It would be a mighty good thing if some one could make
her miserable a few minutes.  That's what I'm trying to get at!
She's got enough brains, if she wasn't too lazy to use them.
She'll be fired next term if she isn't careful, and then where'll
you be?  I'm going to make her quit this eternal fooling
around."
</p>

<p>
"Bronson's spoiled you, Bob.  That's all the matter with you.
You're always wishing Martha would dazzle people, sort of
make them sit up and blink, the way he used to.  It's all right
for a boy to be so terribly clever, but it would be awkward
for a woman.  It would make her conspicuous, Bob."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I wouldn't care so much, Emily, if I could even get
a rise out of her about it.  I light into her, and you know what
she says!  'Yes, daddy!  Yes, daddy!' like a little angel.  And
she hasn't the least idea of doing anything about it.  If she'd
get good and mad about it once, we could get some place.  She
just goes on like a little mule!"
</p>

<p>
"No one but you ever calls her a mule, Bob," Emily cajoled
him.  "Other people seem to lead her about easy enough."
</p>

<p>
"Yes!  Toward a dance, they do.  But how about a
trigonometry?"
</p>

<p>
"You ought to have married a Phi Beta Kappa, Bob, with a
golden key.  You never asked to see my school reports when
you married me; that's where you made your mistake.  She's
her mother's own child, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I never saw a kid less like her mother in my life!  I never
saw anybody like her.  I know I only got through exams. by the
skin of my teeth, but I did work now and then."
</p>

<p>
"Martha works hard enough when anything interests her.
You ought to see people look at her room, Bob.  Grace,
Mrs. Phillips, said to me day before yesterday, 'Goodness, Emily,
you've got a clever daughter.  How old is Martha?  I thought
she was only nineteen.'  She doesn't think she's stupid, Bob.
You just wait.  Martha'll make you proud of her yet!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm waiting, all right.  I've always been waiting.  You
might hurry her along a bit, old girl!"
</p>

<p>
So Bob had waited all that day, without seizing more than
two or three fleeting opportunities to "roast" her about that
report, and he was still waiting the next noon in a rather abused
mood for some of those signs of promise that his wife was
always talking about.  He was thinking about it as he walked
up to dinner, when he suddenly shuddered to recognize his
car, that he ought to have been riding home in, disguised by loads
of flowers, overflowing with bobbed heads, young arms and
joys and shriekings, turned violently&mdash;to escape crashing into a
milk truck&mdash;up over the curb into a neighbor's lawn, just missing
an altogether unyielding elm.
</p>

<p>
Martha was clever enough at least to avoid her father until
dinner was on the table.  Emily, helping the crippled old
maid-of-all-work in the dining room,
heard them at it as they came in
toward the table.
</p>

<p>
"I say you were coming around that corner at forty miles an
hour!"  Then suddenly stopping: "What's this, Emily!  No
company for dinner?  Where's all the gang?  My g-o-oodness! this
is a treat!  I told you, Martha&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
Bob spoke with the abruptness of a man who sells hundreds
of cars a year, and repairs thousands while their drivers wait.
And Martha, when she bothered to reply to him, spoke like a
siren from some island of lotus eaters.  Her sentences, instead
of ending crisply, trailed away rather, and were lost in
indifference.  Emily scarcely knew what to make of her, at
times, nowadays.  She had always been a quiet child.  On the
occasions of high delight in her childhood, which made other
children laugh and shout and dance about with glee, little
Martha had always stood still, her hands clasped together, and
shone all over, with her gray eyes, her little pursed-up mouth,
her whole little soft face.  The shouting, squealing, roaring sort
of little rejoicers are lovely, too, Emily had often thought.  But
this distinctive rising into shining quietness which was so
characteristically Martha, had been a rare and fascinating kind of
infant charm.  And now, in the blossom of her maidenhood,
Martha seemed instinctively to have chosen quietness, and
passivity for her weapon of defense and conquest.  When she
flirted, and when she quarreled with her father, her voice was
like the falling of "tired eyelids on tired eyes."  Emily had said
to Bob, perplexed by Martha's unconciliatory behavior to one
whom Emily would have called in her youth an admirer,
"Johnnie just wants to grab Martha and give her a shaking when
she looks at him like that."  And Bob replied, indignantly: "You
bet your bottom dollar he does!  That's why she does it!"
</p>

<p>
And now Martha, consuming a chop with haste, displeased
with her father's outburst, lifted her eyes slowly toward him
and looked at him casually for a moment, and then, letting her
eyelashes fall, devoted herself to the chop, as she might have
given a moment's careless attention to an English sparrow
perched on the window sill of the house across the road.  And
she drawled, unperturbed to the last degree:
</p>

<p>
"I think you're mistaken, dad.  I don't believe I was driving
that fast.  And, anyway, I stopped in time.  A miss is as good
as a mile, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Not with my car, it isn't.  Not by a damned sight!  You'd
think it was a Lizzie the way you treat it.  A mile is better than
a miss with you, and don't you forget it!  If this happens again,
I won't let you drive the car all summer!"
</p>

<p>
"I said I was sorry, didn't I?  I said I wouldn't do it again.
You never saw me do a thing like that before, did you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I didn't, young lady.  You didn't imagine I was anywhere
about, or I wouldn't have seen you this time, either!  I
give you credit for that much sense, at least!"
</p>

<p>
"How sweet of you, daddy!"
</p>

<p>
"Can't you see what you did?" Bob demanded, excited by her
indifference.  "Can't you see that if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You talk as if I'd plowed up all Parker's lawn.  By the
way, why don't you get that bridge on Whinney's road fixed,
father?  Have we got to go that dusty detour all summer every
time we want a game of golf, when we're only here three
months?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear that, Emily?  I try to put a little sense into her
head, and she begins blaming me because that road isn't mended.
Do you think the roads in this county are made for you kids?
'You haven't had that car a year,'  Perkins says to me yesterday,
'and it looks like a bootleggers' express.'  'Bootleggers nothing!
It's the women,' I said.  'They may be frail, but fenders
crumble under them.'  I remember I said to you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mother, why don't you speak up?  You aren't functioning.
After all, we worked all morning getting <i>you</i> those flowers, and
this is all the thanks we get for it.  I tell you, mommie, there
are absolute <i>tubs</i> of delphiniums in Carson's cellar.  Heavenly
blues!  They'll look cooler than anything to-night.  This
afternoon we're&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"How could you expect to see anything with all that stuff
piled in front of you?"
</p>

<p>
"Stuff!  He calls them 'stuff.'  They're all named varieties,"
she said, "with pedigrees behind them."
</p>

<p>
"Emily, I tell you the car looked like a florist's moving.  That
young fool of a Johnnie Benton riding clear home on the
running board with his arms full of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't let him inside, mother."  Martha spoke virtuously.
"I knew you didn't want them all crushed."
</p>

<p>
"And if he hadn't seen that truck, and hollered and
jumped&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, anyway, he saved the flowers, I'll say that for him.
It's more than I expected him to do, if he did get a fall."
</p>

<p>
"And he didn't even have a shirt on, Emily.  His coat flew
open as he fell&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Bob, surely he must have had a shirt on!  What did he
have on, Martha?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry I don't know, mother.  I didn't understand
father wanted me to examine all the fellows' B.V.D.'s.  He'd
been playing tennis, and he just grabbed some sweater when we
hollered to him to come along.  Next time I pick up a man, I'll
say to him, 'If you haven't got a nice proper undershirt on, you
can't go riding in my father's car.'"
</p>

<p>
Bob snorted.
</p>

<p>
"Who said anything about undershirts?  A nice thing for a
girl like you to be talking about!"
</p>

<p>
"You mean he didn't have an undershirt on?  He wasn't
certainly stark naked, mother."  Martha suddenly had become
prim.
</p>

<p>
"All I say is, he wasn't dressed right to go riding with girls.
You listen to what I'm saying, Martha!  If you had gone bang
into the truck, not a bone in your body&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And what happened then to interrupt him, Bob said happened
every time he tried to "settle" Martha.  A hooting and a tooting
of horns, and laughing and whistles, from the street intervened.
Martha jumped up.
</p>

<p>
"There they are," she said to her mother.  "Send the car
up by three, dad.  I suppose you can trust the old bus to me if
mother is along.  It isn't a Rolls-Royce, after all."  She stood
gobbling down the dessert.  With her fork she pushed together
the last crumbs on her plate, and lifting it, she turned her
smooth bobbed head halfway towards her father, and practically
winking one gray eye towards her mother, she remarked,
demurely, with an indifference that made the words absurd:
</p>

<p>
"My God!  That was some cherry pie!"
</p>

<p>
Bob watched her depart, wilting, and turned to his wife.
</p>

<p>
"There you are, Emily!" he protested.  It was as if he said,
"Look how your child acts."  She was, in fact, still Emily's
child, as she had always been.  Bob accepted responsibility now
for her no more than ever.  "She talks as if I was a Long
Island millionaire.  As if she couldn't waste her precious time
saving a mere Packard from a smash-up.  How many times
have I told her not to pile more than eight people into the car?
And thirteen of them piled out.  One after another.  Sitting on
one another's laps.  Just sitting on one another.  A fat chance
of the boys using their own cars when they can get a girl to
hold on their knees.  And when I bawled her out, she said there
were only two in the front seat!  If Johnnie hadn't happened
to see that truck&mdash;&mdash;!"  Bob shrugged.  "And all she says, in
the end, is, 'Send up the old bus.  My God!  What a pie!'"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Bob, I've told you that she's reached years of
discretion&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Discretion!  That's a good one!"
</p>

<p>
"She chooses to use your expressions.  I'm not going to say
anything.  I spanked her often enough for it when she was a
baby.  Anyway, she only does it to annoy you.  She never uses
it with me."
</p>

<p>
"God alone knows what she uses when she's with that gang!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, they're having a good time, Bob.  She won't be
home many more summers."
</p>

<p>
"Why won't she?  Where's she going?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know&mdash;exactly.  I mean&mdash;she'll be getting married.
She'll be taking up some work."
</p>

<p>
And Emily, sitting there enjoying her juicy sweet cherries
thoroughly, found some pleasure in the situation.  At least, it
had its elements of satisfaction in it, even though the
growing&mdash;what should she call it?&mdash;misunderstanding between Martha
and Bob made her sigh, often.  For twenty years she had been
annoyed, inwardly and ineffectively, by Bob's choice of
expletives.  And this chit of a child, by her occasional use of
them that made her father shudder, kept him free from them
for weeks together.  If in her childhood he had ignored her, at
least undervalued her, he was getting well paid for it just at
present.
</p>

<p>
"Just as if I hadn't said a word to her!  'Send up the car at
three,' she says, just like that, as if it was <i>her</i> car.  You'd
think the only reason a father existed was to keep a car in
repair for her."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that is one reason for them existing.  Besides, she
did say she was sorry.  She said it two or three times.  She
promised not to do it again.  I'm never afraid when she's
driving, Bob.  She never seems to me to lose her head."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no.  Of course not.  She's mighty careful to keep you
on her side.  She wouldn't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"On her side, old silly," Emily said, soothingly.  "You talk
as if there was some quarrel between you two.  You know
very well that if there was I'd never let her know I was, for a
second.  She's worked like a Trojan for to-night.  I didn't see
how I could possibly get over to Elgin this afternoon.  And she
offered to drive me over."
</p>

<p>
"Never you mind about <i>that</i>!  She'll not miss anything.
She'll go shopping while you call, if she can find anything
worth buying.  Or else she's made a date to meet somebody.
I bet three minutes after she leaves you there, she'll have some
young idiot making eyes at her in that car.  I'll bet you a dollar
she's 'phoned some of them she's coming over."
</p>

<p>
"Well, suppose she has, Bob.  What do you expect of a girl?
Do you want her to sit in the car with her eyes shut till I'm
ready to come home?  Why shouldn't she call up her friends?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know it, Emily.  But it's the principle of the thing.
They're such a lazy bunch.  They never do a thing but spend
money and dance.  That's what Fielding was saying to me."
</p>

<p>
Emily giggled perversely&mdash;effectively.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well; have it your own way.  They're all angels, if you
say they are.  I never interfere with them.  Give them enough
rope and they'll all hang themselves."
</p>

<p>
"Have some more pie," Emily urged.  "A little more pie
won't hurt you.  I've got to begin canning cherries to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, can the canning!  What do you want to stew in the
kitchen for, weather like this?"
</p>

<p>
When Emily left the table she went quickly to the kitchen.
Strange how the maid's conscience could prick the mistress!
Old Maggie now was crippled and Emily had promised to take
the ironed clothes yesterday from the clothes horse and put
them away.  She had forgotten, almost cruelly forgotten, for
to have something done on Thursday that should have been done
on Wednesday was pain to Maggie.  To that pathetic sensitiveness
her years of faithful service had brought her.  No woman
in town but Emily would have endured the crankiness of the
old thing, the neighbors said.  But Emily from infancy had
been used to her tyranny, and to her any servant was better
than none at all.  She apologized for having forgotten.  And
Maggie, hobbling around, demanded that she look at Martha's
best "chimmey."  The woman had scorched it, burned it, and
doubled her fault carefully in so Emily wouldn't see it.  And
Emily looked at it, and grumbled a little, sympathizingly, and
then spoiled the effect of her good deed by saying the garment
was almost worn out, anyway.  Whereat Maggie snorted.  Did
that excuse the careless, lazy, sneaky woman for folding it in
so deceitfully?  Certainly not, Emily hurried to assure her,
trying to sound efficient and superior, and knowing as she went
through the living room with an armful of mending that she
had seemed as usual but a broken reed to the old thing who
needed something strong, now, to lean on.
</p>

<p>
Bob saw her task, and said, of course:
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you make Martha do that for you?"
</p>

<p>
"You know she's gone to work on the committee, getting
things ready for to-night.  She's busy."
</p>

<p>
"Busy!  Huh!" remarked Bob.
</p>

<p>
Emily had intended to get a lot of work done before Martha
came back for her.  Those bathroom sash curtains really must be
changed.  But a neighbor "ran in" for a minute.  She wanted
to talk about her grandchild, and Emily forgot her hurry.  And
then she thought she would take some of those lovely columbines
to her friend's mother in Elgin.  And so she went out and cut
some, and wasn't at all ready to go when Martha came for her,
calling up to her to hurry if she wanted to get back by five.
But Emily seized her and made her wait.
</p>

<p>
"Martha, sit down a minute.  Listen to me.  You're a bad
child.  You ought to be spanked.  I wish&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know it, mother," Martha answered, sincerely.  "I'm
the limit.  Can you imagine me talking that way to anyone
else?  But dad does get my goat, some way.  What does he
want to keep on after me for, after I've told him I'm sorry?
He's just got into the habit of ya-ya-ya-ing at me, and he'll just
have to get out of it.  I'm not going to have it.  Did you see him
writhe, mother, when I mygodded him?"  And Martha
chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"We've had enough of that now, Martha!  You can stop
that just now.  You know I don't think you're the one to correct
your father!"
</p>

<p>
"But if I don't, who will?  You're no good at it.  You're too
good-natured with him, you old precious lamb.  He knows you
don't like his godding.  Does he stop?  I know he doesn't like
mine.  Do I stop?  We've got to be logical."
</p>

<p>
Emily smiled witheringly.
</p>

<p>
"Your logic is always so unexpected.  Do behave yourself.
You might at least ask him to send up the car, instead of
ordering him to.  He doesn't keep it for your benefit, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know about that.  If he keeps it just for himself,
he's a selfish pig.  If he keeps it partly for ours, why
should we hesitate to acknowledge it?  You're always defending
him."
</p>

<p>
"Defending him from whom?  He doesn't need any defense
that I know of.  He hasn't got any enemies."
</p>

<p>
"Well, maybe I shouldn't have said defense.  That's not the
word, maybe.  But you'll have to acknowledge that he needs a
good deal of&mdash;ahem&mdash;explanation, mother.  You see for yourself
he stops swearing like a sailor when I take him in hand.
Everybody says 'My God.'  But when he uses it you'd think he
was a drunken sailor.  Mother, come along.  There's all that
decoration to do when we get back.  You can't trust them to do
anything unless somebody's there to boss them.  Get your hat."
</p>

<p>
They went out of the door together, and down the front
walk to where the car waited in thick shade.  The famous
barberry hedge that divides the Kenworthy front lawn from
the street dozes faintly in June, waking really only in October.
But the lindens whose branches almost met across the narrow
street were in the murmurous climax of leaf and blossom that
day.  Emily climbed into the car.  Martha jumped in, slipped
into the driving seat, and banged the door after her.  Now
Emily, when necessity compelled her to manipulate Bob's car,
approached it humbly and coaxed it into action, praying it would
get around the next corner safely.  But Martha just seized it,
and slapped it into obedience, and imperiously commanded it
hither and thither hastily.  Emily never saw her take charge of
it without a sort of impulse of awe.  The car, like everything
else expensive, seemed to become the girl.  She moved her
hands on the large steering wheel with that surprising
composure which Emily had admired from her babyhood.  She
always drove bareheaded.  The breeze scarcely disturbed her
hair, which was cut and combed almost as it had been ten years
ago, when Jim Kenworthy used to sit and stroke it thoughtfully.
There was never a day when Martha was at home that
Emily didn't notice how distinguished the absolute straightness
and fineness of that black hair seemed among shingled and
marcelled heads.  Bob didn't like bobbed hair, but he didn't
make such an absolute fool of himself on the subject as some
men did.  Emily herself liked to think that there had never been
any "putting up" of hair for her daughter.  There had never
been a day when a box of hairpins definitely divided her
maturity from her childhood.  There had never been any letting
down of skirts for Martha.  Her frocks, still cut simply, hung
from her shoulders to&mdash;well, why should a man go fussing on
indefinitely about the length of his daughter's skirts, after they
had been determined!  Of course, if Martha had had fat legs,
and shaky hips, like some girls whose names might be
mentioned, Emily might not have admired the prevailing styles so
sincerely.  But Martha was built slenderly enough, gracefully
enough, to justify them, Emily thought, looking at her sitting
there like a little child, in that pink gingham frock, uncorseted,
unrestrained, all delicately and subtly blooming with color.
</p>

<p>
And Emily, though she enjoyed her daughter in perfect whiffs
of satisfaction, looked at her not without uneasiness.  For she
knew, when she sat looking at that child, that she was seeing
bodily before her eyes nineteen years of her life; and not the
quantity of it only, but the very quality, the very flavor of it.
Everything she had done she had done for that child; all that
she had left undone she had left undone for her.  Even Jim,
the brother of her husband, whom she had loved, she had given
up, she had kept distant from, for this child's sake.  Often since
he had died, six years ago, she had regretted that renunciation.
She had thought bitterly at times that if she had gone to him,
divorced or not divorced, child or no child, he might&mdash;who
knew?&mdash;be living still.  But generally, when she thought of it
all, when Martha was with her, she had been glad of her
decision.  Martha was surely reward enough for any sacrifice a
woman could make.
</p>

<p>
Because Martha was happy.  That was the whole point.  If
her mother had divorced her father, or deserted him, surely
there must have been something like a shadow, a sort of dimness,
over the child's consciousness.  But now how gay she was,
how perfectly gay and light-hearted.  For Emily, who had
been an unhappy lonely young girl, that was enough.  She
fervently now loved the months when the whole house rose up
to the zest of youth, when the rugs were rolled up and the
victrola going, when the refrigerator was raided nightly, when
the clothes lines were always adorned with swimming suits, the
bathroom overflowing with girls, the railings even of the
veranda lined with lads, cigarettes gleaming in the darkness of
the garden&mdash;why ask whether feminine or masculine cigarettes&mdash;when
there was no sleep till the last lingering car departing had
made the night strident.  Bob grumbled incessantly about
Martha's company.  But must not an only child, most of all,
have friends about?  "You'd think the house was run for that
girl," Bob complained.  And Emily answered to herself, for
she was a wise one: "If this house of mine is run eight months
of the year for you, why shouldn't it be run four months of the
year for her?"  But she said only: "Too bad!  It's just a shame."
</p>

<p>
For physically, she got tired of it herself.  Thank Heaven
the rush which had been accumulating for weeks would be
over this evening!  It was an added misfortune that the old
friend visiting in Elgin had 'phoned that Emily must come to
see her this very afternoon, or miss her altogether.  So here
she and Martha, in the midst of the preparations, were slipping
across counties together, as if distance was nothing.  And
truly to Martha Kenworthy it was nothing worth raising an
eyelash excitedly about.  They slipped silently by cornfields,
with straight little lines of green checking away geometrically
for level miles.  They slipped by alfalfa-green fields, clover-green
fields, oat-green fields, wheat-green fields, farmhouses,
high loads of balancing hay, milk trucks.  The sun was hot.
The air was clear.  The sky was blue.  And on the horizon
magnificently distant, beyond those subtle sloping fields, rose
towering white and blooming higher, in puff upon puff and fold
upon fold, huge white culminating clouds of dreams.  Emily,
lulled almost to unconsciousness, saw a black one rising
ominously among them.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Look at that!" she murmured, breaking a fragrant silence.
</p>

<p>
Martha looked.
</p>

<p>
"We should worry!" she replied.  She was right, of course.
Nothing less than an earthquake could spoil the climax of the
women's triumph now.
</p>

<p>
The growth of their conception, the building of their dream
into concrete foundations and that perfect dancing floor, was
a thing that every woman who had had a hand in it was wondering
over this week, and Emily had more reason than most of
them to wonder.  For she was by nature less a committee woman
than any of them.  She had to think out every step of her
participation in it, to believe she was really part of it.  She
always forgot even her most important motives, and puzzled
afterwards over all the reasons for her actions which at the
time had seemed obvious.  In her early married life she had
been too poor and too busy to consider the women's club.
Besides, it had been bullied then by the aunt whose house Emily
had escaped from by marriage.  And after the aunt died, and
Emily moved again into the good house her grandfather and
aunt had been rebuilding for some seventy years, she had not
wanted to take her place in the circle which might, she suspected,
be discussing the gossip about her husband's speculation with
some money her aunt had intrusted to him.  And she had had
a baby then, soon after she had come back to the house, a poor
little starving son who kept her and Bob bending over him night
and day for nearly two years.  And then Jim had come to
them, bringing his tragic son.  And her old girlish love for
him had risen like a flood, like a flood that never burst its
dam, but pushed and pounded there against it&mdash;till Jim died.
</p>

<p>
Life had collapsed then.  Just collapsed.  It had no content
at all.  She had come to realize that most of the years of
her married life had been given their value by her love of her
first lover, her husband's brother.  From the day he took
his departure from town until the next time he came to see
his mother, she had lived in anticipation of the days when he
would be about the house, "jollying" in his charming way, his
frail and doting mother, and playing about with Martha, and
every minute, under his discreet and brotherly words, loving
her, the girl he had so incredibly missed marrying.  There had
been for her then that certainty, and besides that, some place
in the depth of her mind a vague, foolish, romantic,
unacknowledged hope of some time, some place, loving him
altogether.  She had to believe that that little hope had been
the mainspring of her life.  For, after his death, without it,
she couldn't go on, she had thought desperately.  Life had
stopped.
</p>

<p>
And just then that woman, Mrs. Benton, who had lived in
the next block for years, suddenly strode into Emily's
consciousness, in the same way that a few years before she had
landed with a running jump in the defenseless mind of the
community.  Mrs. Benton had had an only daughter who had
been drowned.  She had brooded over the fact for a while,
and then risen and said she was going to have every child in that
inland town taught to swim.  As a memorial to that daughter
she would make the town a swimming beach.  She had bought
a wooded stretch of the river bank.  She had dammed the river.
She had made a great dark bottomless swimming place for the
strong lads, and little clear wading pools for the toddlers.  She
had made sunny diving places and shady diving places and
steep gravel banks and grassy inclines, and dressing rooms
of varieties.  And all summer she stationed guards there and
instructors, and got Johnnie Weismuller to come down to her
yearly water festivals, to do his stunts and encourage the
winners of all the water races.  It was impossible to imagine a
swimming beach more skillfully managed.  The Rotarians had
to acknowledge that the beach was the town's best booster.
Who could deny that farmers came now to trade in that town,
with their Fords and their Cadillacs packed full of eager
bathing suits who had been kept in order the whole week by
the promise of a swim on Saturday?
</p>

<p>
After that, she had gone on to improve the city and ruin the
temper of the taxpayers.  She had built and she had paved
and she had investigated, she had reformed and she had tested
laws, and she had hoisted taxes.  Men said horrid things about
Mrs. Benton.  They said, "she was out to raise municipal
hell," and that she was "just too damned efficient to live."  And
when a small boy, a mere little unconsidered Hicks child,
quarreling with his playmate, cried, "You needn't think you
can go Bentoning around my back yard," they took up the
verb derisively and put it into all the male mouths of the
county, where it lives to this day.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had the beach become a success beyond any
expectation, than Mrs. Benton had addressed the women's
club.  "Our children," she said, "swim now from June to
October <i>de luxe</i>; and from October to June they dance&mdash;how?
Behind the Greek's candyshop, where those obscene pictures
were found, in the old hall that has no ventilation, or the old
opera house controlled by bootleggers.  Why should the women
not build a winter gathering-place for their children equal to
the summer center?"  The women had said, "We will."  "I
wish I could afford to do it all myself," she said.  And the
plan they made knocked the breath out of their menfolk.  Why,
demanded husbands, couldn't they listen to common sense and
build an ordinary hall?  They didn't want a cheap hall.  Why
couldn't they build it in the town park?  It was too low there,
and hot and crowded.  Why must it be built on the hill across
the river from the beach, to which no paved road led, and no
bridge was convenient?  They some way liked that hill.  Why
not pave a road and build a bridge and make a great new municipal
parking place, which had to be done sooner or later?  The
city council refused to have any such white elephant forced
upon them.  White elephant, indeed, the women echoed, Mrs. Benton
leading them.  A mere kitten for the baby to play with.
</p>

<p>
If the council wouldn't accept it, very well.  The women's
club would build it to suit itself, would manage it, and endow
it.  And through four years of opposition and complications
they had worked steadily on, straight to the dedication of the
hall which now, full of the morning delphiniums, waited for
its evening christening.  And Emily was very tired.
</p>

<p>
For Mrs. Benton was clever enough to realize her own weaknesses,
and in launching the dancing-center plan she had felt
the need of some one to pour oil on the waters she troubled.
And there was Emily Kenworthy, just at hand, who was, as
Johnnie Benton said, a "natural born oil-can," an easy-going
woman who got along with anyone, even that cranky old
servant that bossed her around.  So Mrs. Benton had pounced
upon Emily.  And Emily had submitted, with misgivings, welcoming
any relief from the vacancy of life she had suffered since
Jim's death.  The strife of it all was nothing to Emily.  She
had never found stimulus in overcoming opposition.  She had
no respect for committees, no interest in rules of order.  Blue
prints made her yawn, and the very idea of signing her name
to a contract oppressed her.  From the first she had seen the
project merely as a toy for Martha, a patch of sunlight in her
daughter's background.  It had been only her interest in
Martha and all those children about her that had kept Emily
working away these five years, while one woman after another
had resigned in fury.
</p>

<p>
Emily had been so unhappy as a child that her mind enjoyed
playing with the idea of a beautiful gathering-place all lighted
and shining by a multitude of happy boys and girls.  She had
always liked the children who played about with Martha.  And
since that summer during the war, when Jim's son, that dear,
befuddled, tragic Bronson, had carried the burden of his
unnecessary sorrow all those weeks unsuspected beneath her very
eyes, she had never passed a half-grown lad on the street
without a second wondering look at him.  How could a town be
stupid, she often wondered, having in it a world esoteric,
unexplored, unimagined for the most part by adults, very jungles
of young terror hiding adolescent beds of precious ore.  "How
do you come to know all the children in town?" women asked
Emily more than once.  "They can't <i>all</i> come to see Martha."  But
if you're interested, you do get to know them some way.
They run errands, they deliver groceries, they come about selling
tickets to high-school plays, they spray the apple trees in the
spring, they borrow books&mdash;they just some way hang about.
At least that was Emily's explanation.
</p>

<p>
The whole community she had come to think of as a nursery
for Martha and her kind.  Her grandfather, to be sure, had
laid out the main street of the town, and Bob had adorned one
corner of it recently with a huge yawning garage, but the real
importance to Emily of those streets was the fact that Martha
and her friends strolled along them towards their sundaes.  Her
grandfather had planted the trees about the house.  But Emily
had come to esteem them because they had afforded high swings
for little girls.  Emily had first seen Jim Kenworthy under
the willow that leaned out over the river where her back
yard meets the water.  Bob had proposed to her in that very
spot.  But now that tree was precious because Martha's boat
was generally anchored there.  And when Bob talked of sawing
off that lower limb, to build a new garage, she had risen in
arms because Martha had as a child spent hours in that broad
seat it made.  She had never been allowed herself to climb
trees, but Martha had spent whole mornings there, and soon,
in not many years, well&mdash;who could tell, maybe Martha's own
boys and girls would be hiding their treasures in those lovely
soft hollow places within reach of young hands.  She couldn't
just say to Bob that she was saving that very low limb for her
grandchildren, could she?  And she never exactly said to
Mrs. Benton that she was working for the community hall
because she didn't want Martha to dance only out there in the
country club aloof from the life of the town.  Emily had been
taught to consider the Western town a place scarcely worthy
of her Eastern breeding.  She wasn't going to have any such
nonsense as that with Martha.  She'd send her East to school,
but she was to feel herself altogether Western.  And it was
high time she did, too, since she was the fourth generation to
live in the West.
</p>

<p>
However, whatever the motives, whatever the difficulties,
the work had been accomplished.  Day by day, all the spring
putting in whole mornings over the finishing of it, they had
labored away, and they would be infinitely relieved when it
was over to-morrow.  Emily was weary with it all.  The car
rolled along, smoothly, as usual, when Martha took it over the
bad roads, and, musing sleepily, she thought of all the women
had done, and wondered pleasantly why this old friend she was
going to see had decided so suddenly to return to her home that
Emily must come to see her a few minutes that very afternoon.
She was almost asleep when she heard Martha's voice, a rather
stern tone of it:
</p>

<p>
"Mother!"
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't often criticize you, do I now?"
</p>

<p>
"Not very often.  I suppose you're a rather tolerant daughter,
as daughters go.  What have I done now?"  Emily yawned.
</p>

<p>
"I was just thinking about things.  Both dad and Uncle Jim
lived in this town when you were a girl, didn't they?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you marry Uncle Jim, then?"
</p>

<p>
Emily sat up.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Martha Kenworthy!  What put such an idea into
your head?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Dad</i> puts it there, of course.  It's been there for years, off
and on.  I didn't tell you what was in my head, when I was
a kid."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you didn't, didn't you?"  The idea of her saying that!
</p>

<p>
"No, I didn't dare.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Martha!" Emily expostulated.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I didn't.  I've often wondered about it.  I told Maggie
once I liked Uncle Jim most, and she said bad little girls who
said things like that died in their sleep.  It seems to me&mdash;of
course I was just a little kid then&mdash;some way, I had sort of
an affinity for Uncle Jim.  Funny you never had.  I wonder
sometimes&mdash;&mdash;  Do you suppose if he was living now I would
still be so crazy about him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, you know, mother, you do feel different about
your forbears when you're grown up.  Dad didn't used to
seem&mdash;so&mdash;odious when I was a kid."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Martha," Emily
answered, carelessly.  She would not seem to take this
seriously.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why.  Maybe Uncle Jim would have bored me
just as much.  Of course you always <i>taught</i> me to love dad
when I was little.  I simply had to, you might say.  You used
to say he never had any time to play with me.  But when you
come to think of it, he had loads more time than ever Uncle
Jim did.  He was only here sometimes, when he came to see
grandma.  But some way, when I look back at it, it seems as if
he played with me for years, almost."
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course he did play with you whenever he came.
He said it was a rest for him.  He was always tired.  He
enjoyed fooling about with you."
</p>

<p>
"I know it.  Do you remember the day he rolled up his
trousers and took me wading on his shoulder?  There could
have been hardly any water in the river then, before it was
dammed, but I thought I would have drowned if I went near
it.  And he played he was sinking, and ran round and round
splashing, and told me I had saved his life.  I didn't know
whether I really had or not.  Gee! mother!"  Martha chuckled
reminiscently.  "I'll bet I would just love him if he was
living."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure you would."
</p>

<p>
"I asked you, in the first place, why you didn't marry him
instead of father.  You would have if you'd consulted me about
it, all right.  I bet I wasn't more than eight when I began to
think about that.  He wouldn't have been always jawing me
every time I came in sight."
</p>

<p>
Emily was wide awake now.
</p>

<p>
"Why, child, I don't know, exactly.  He was older than I
was&mdash;a little bit.  What you remember of him&mdash;all his ways of
playing with you&mdash;wouldn't necessarily make a girl prefer him.
You don't ever think what sort of fathers these lads would
make for children, do you?  These boys that play about with
you."
</p>

<p>
Martha looked at her mother in indignation.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I should say I <i>do</i>!  I'm going to have a first-class
father for <i>my</i> children!"  This was what Emily delighted in,
Martha's frank way of discussing things unembarrassed with
her.  There was never a grown woman she could have said a
thing like that to when she was a girl!  "If anybody asks me to
marry him," Martha continued&mdash;-"I don't mean like Johnnie
and these boys&mdash;I mean in earnest&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do these boys ask you to marry them?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you know, mother.  They'd ask anybody just to try it.
Johnnie's got to practice on someone&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"But suppose someone should accept him&mdash;now&mdash;I mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, the risk would be all her own," Martha said,
serenely.  "If anybody asked me seriously, I'd say to him:
'Let me hear you sing backwards.  Let me see you go upstairs
rabbit and come down alligator.'  And if he couldn't play
games nicely, like Uncle Jim, I'd say there's nothing doing."
</p>

<p>
Emily laughed at the absurdity of the child.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to hear it," she said railingly.  And then she added:
"You'll wait a long time before you come across one like him.
There isn't one in a million."
</p>

<p>
Martha turned and looked at her mother with deliberate
curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"I should have thought you would just love him, mother!"
</p>

<p>
"I did.  We all did.  He had such lovely ways."
</p>

<p>
"You'd never imagine dad belonged to the same family."
</p>

<p>
"Anybody could see they did.  They're very much alike.
Martha, you don't do your father justice.  You wait till you get
into trouble and you'll see whether he's a good friend or not."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Well, maybe I won't get into trouble.  There's no
certainty.  I know now very well what he'd do.  He'd do
anything he could for me because I'm your little pet."
</p>

<p>
"You're a ridiculous child, Martha."
</p>

<p>
"I know that.  You say that whenever you don't want to
acknowledge I've hit the nail on the head."
</p>

<p>
"I said plainly your dad is of another temperament."
</p>

<p>
"I'll say he is!"
</p>

<p>
"Isn't life too funny?" thought Emily.  "Jim's boy has spoiled
Bob for Martha, and Jim makes Bob seem uninteresting to
Martha.  Things go too much in circles in the family," she
thought to herself.  And Emily sat there, not listening closely
to Martha's chatter.  She was thinking about her startling
question.  <i>Could</i> Martha really have wondered about that when
she was eight?  What was the use of imagining one saw into a
child's mind!  Had the child ever seen things on the face
of her uncle or her mother that had made her wonder things she
didn't yet dare to ask about?  After all, Martha had been twelve
when Jim died.  An hour before Emily would have laughed
at such an idea.  And after all, suppose the child <i>did</i>
understand!  If she did, she understood nothing
dishonorable&mdash;nothing a girl nowadays might not meditate upon.
</p>

<p>
For girls nowadays&mdash;well, Bob the other night came into the
dining room declaring violently he couldn't sit on the veranda
with them.  That Ellis girl had been saying&mdash;and Johnnie was
there, and that beach guard he runs about with&mdash;she had said
right in front of those men that she had to dramatize some part
of the Bible next fall term, and she had chosen the fall of
Jericho because of the harlot in it.  And Martha had said,
"Goodness!  You can find a story with more than one harlot
in it.  Can't she, Johnnie?"  And Johnnie had had the decency
to say he didn't know.  He hadn't been to Sunday school for a
long time.  Emily had been sure Martha had done it simply to
shock Bob.  She defended the girls.  "I don't care what you
say, Bob.  It's a lot better than the way I was brought up.  It's
just a good thing that they talk so frankly with me about such
things."  And yet&mdash;once in a while&mdash;she had misgivings&mdash;not
so much about Martha, of course&mdash;who was a good child&mdash;but
about Eve, for instance, and other girls.

<i>Chapter Two</i>
</h3>

<p>
"You go right over to the hall," Emily had said to Martha as
they arrived home after five, "and I'll do your shoulder straps
for you."  She had gone upstairs, and presently hurried, in a
comfortable mature way, to Martha's room.  She opened the
door, and almost blinked, for the uncompromising afternoon
sun made even yet a startling welter of the purples and greens
and creamy yellows before her.  And then she said: "Oh!  You
here, Eve?"  For in that whirl of gaudiness an auburn-haired,
hawk-nosed, thin-faced girl sat in flesh-colored B.V.D.'s, on
a black stool, with a dishpan half full of pitted cherries on the
floor beside her, and in her lap a green bowl half full of moist
seeds.
</p>

<p>
"I got tired of hanging around over there.  I wasn't doing
anything.  They're just fooling around for somebody to come
and make them get to work."  It was no concession to Emily's
sense of propriety that made her hitch a fallen shoulder strap
into decorum.  Eve could have pitted cherries in Martha's
sitting room stark naked with serenity.  She had gone into
shrieks of laughter the other day when Emily had described
the careful way in which she in her girlhood, in her own room,
with no man in the house, had put her arms into her wrapper
in her bed, and had the essential garment all ready to pull about
her as soon as she had put her first foot on the floor.
</p>

<p>
Emily said to her now, "You needn't have done those
cherries, Eve."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, I thought I'd better be doing something to make
myself popular.  Everybody else is working&mdash;or pretending
to."  Eve grinned ingratiatingly.  "Somebody called up, too, just
now.  That friend of Martha's.  That Wilton, I think his name
is."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Is HE here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Came out for to-night.  Don't you like him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I like him.  He's a nice boy.  Clever, too."
</p>

<p>
"That's what Martha said."  Eve seemed always incredulous
about masculine brilliancy.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he's always got scholarships.  He's earned his way,
really, through college."
</p>

<p>
"Hum!" commented Eve.  College honors were nothing to her.
</p>

<p>
"His father is the best barber in town, too," Emily continued.
</p>

<p>
Eve turned and looked at her quickly.
</p>

<p>
"The best what?"
</p>

<p>
"Barber.  You know that shop all plate glass and shining
enamel that makes all the rest of the street look dirty?  That's
his shop.  That's where we go for shampoos."
</p>

<p>
Eve had been looking at Emily curiously, and the little grin
had grown into a spreading smile.
</p>

<p>
"You're the limit, Mrs. Kenworthy!" she said, admiringly.
Then she saw Emily's purpose in coming, and got up.  She
stretched up an arm, spread her dripping fingers gingerly apart,
and brushed back her hair with the inside of her elbow.  "I'll
do those straps.  I've almost finished.  Wait a minute."  And
she started, apparently, towards the bathroom.
</p>

<p>
"Eve!  Wait!  I'll put your kimona on for you!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I'm sorry I forgot!"
</p>

<p>
"It's almost supper time.  Bob may be home any time now."
</p>

<p>
And Emily wrapped about her shoulders a wisp of georgette.
And when the girl took a step forward with all the sunlight
shining through her, and Emily saw through the sheer thing
long pink legs, she suddenly realized why Bob had said
indignantly that he would as soon meet her naked in the hall as in
that thing.
</p>

<p>
She laughed and said, "Eve, you really ought to have a
thicker dressing gown!"
</p>

<p>
"I have got one," Eve assured her.  "I had to get one.  Dad
wouldn't go on the Pullman with me till he saw I had one.  I
hate a lot of cotton flannels."
</p>

<p>
"Crêpe de Chine would do."
</p>

<p>
"I know it.  But it's sort of dowdy&mdash;crêpe de Chine.  Put
Martha's on me.  I'll bring my own Victorian down to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Very quick to take a suggestion, properly made, Eve was.
A gratifying girl to befriend, if a puzzling one.  When Bob
had grumbled that he didn't see any use sending a girl to
college who didn't know enough to wear clothes, Emily had
replied:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that girl is as good as gold, Bob.  They all wear thin
things in the halls, Martha says."  Emily liked her.  To be
sure, the ease with which she had taken up her permanent abode
at the Kenworthys' was somewhat&mdash;nonplusing.  Emily had
asked her, when Martha first brought her home, where she had
been brought up.  And she had said: "Oh, I never was
brought up at all.  I'm just the little prairie flower, growing
wilder every hour.  Just hauled about from aunt to
boarding-school&mdash;between the devil and the deep sea all my tender
days."  Though she had said it so frankly, so seriously, Emily
had thought it scarcely sufficient.  But Martha had hooted at
Emily's quizzings.  "It's too funny the way you act, mother,
as if maybe she wasn't fit to associate with your precious child.
At school I'm simply nothing.  I'm the least worm in the
apple.  But Eve's everything.  The profs just eat out of her
hands.  She's chairman of the student council&mdash;you know&mdash;the
gang that makes us all behave.  She edits the magazine,
and she'll be president of her class next year, as like as not.
At school everybody wants to get a stand in with Eve.  She'd
never looked at me if her dad hadn't moved to this town.  And
now you don't know whether I better make her acquaintance or
not!"
</p>

<p>
"You know I didn't mean that, child.  I simply asked who
she was and where she had lived.  That's only natural.  I
think she's a dear."
</p>

<p>
And Emily had been reassured because it was her theory that
women never again have such a capacity for judging one another
rightly, and choosing friends wisely, as they have in college.
No girl, she thought, looking at Eve's thin, rather over-bred
face, fools a campusful of her companions.  Bob said her father
was always well spoken of.  No one knew him very well.  He
had bought a great elevator in town some time ago, one of
several he had in the state, and recently had bought a large old
house and settled his family in it.  That had consisted of his
old bedridden mother and her nurse&mdash;until Eve's vacation had
begun.  Martha had gone at once to see her there, and, coming
back, had said to Emily: "It's a funny sort of house, mother.
It's furnished all right, and everything.  But it looks like an
orphan asylum."  She had asked Eve to come and stay the night,
and Eve had accepted gladly.  Her grandmother, she told
Emily, had been "out of her head, mildly" for months.  Her
nurses weren't very easy to get along with.  "Dad had a hard
enough time getting any he can trust grandma to," she had said,
very sensibly.  "He's away so much.  These two are awfully
good to her.  I'll say that for them.  They're sisters.  So
why should I come home for three months and ball everything
up?  I just keep still as a mouse and let them have their own
way.  Grandma never knows me.  I never go into the room."
</p>

<p>
Well, that was a nice sort of place for a young girl to spend
her holiday, Emily had thought.  "Stay with us," she had
suggested.  And she hadn't had to suggest it twice.  Bob
grumbled every day about this steady boarder, but that didn't
excite Emily unduly.  She liked Eve better and better.  How
sweet of her now, to think of doing those cherries!  She was
always doing little things that Martha would never have thought
of.
</p>

<p>
In fact, Emily had almost to acknowledge to herself that
Eve had certain traits that Martha might well have had.  Bob,
of course, talked about them openly.  Eve had a proper attitude
towards her father, for one thing.  She had said, quite naturally,
that her dad was a lamb, a perfect duck, and a good old sport.
And the fourth evening she had been at Emily's, the four of
them, with another girl, Johnnie Benton, and another lad of
the town, had been sitting on the veranda, waiting for the
third lad to come in his car, so that the six of them could drive
over to the lake to dance.  They had heard some one come in,
and called to him to come out, thinking it was the dilatory sixth.
And Eve's father had come out to them.
</p>

<p>
Bob couldn't get over that scene.  Eve had sprung up and
hugged him and kissed him and patted him.  Emily, seeing even
that greeting, would have been sure that Eve's rather shocking
sophistication was only a pose.  For she had started at once to
get her things together to go home with him.  And when
Johnnie Benton had protested she had turned to him indignantly.
"I like your nerve!" she had cried to him.  "Do you
suppose I'm going to a dance with you when I haven't seen my
dad for six weeks?"  And she wouldn't go.  They couldn't
persuade her.  Bob, sitting there, had seen her father relishing
the situation.  The man obviously overflowed with pride in his
"Evelyn."
</p>

<p>
"Now, can you beat that?" Bob had demanded of Emily
afterwards.  "Can you imagine Martha cutting a dance for me?
Maybe Eve'll do her some good.  Can you beat that?"
</p>

<p>
Emily couldn't possibly imagine Martha preferring her
father to a dance, or to very much else.  But she wouldn't
acknowledge it.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, Bob, that's another matter.  It was sweet, the
way she did it.  But Eve hadn't seen him for weeks.  And
then, she hasn't got a mother.  She's had to depend on him
always.  It's much more normal, I must say, for a girl to
prefer a dance to her parents.  You can't deny that."
</p>

<p>
"I know it.  But it's the principle of the thing."  And he
had liked Eve, till he had met her coming from the bathroom
in what he called, "an obscene Mother Hubbard."
</p>

<p>
And now, getting ready for supper, Emily wished she knew
why Eve had, once, mentioned father-in-law in connection with
Wilton.  Bob would have laughed at her, if he had known, for
she thought every man in town was in love with Martha, he said.
A fat chance she had of getting near her as hard-headed a man
as Wilton.  He had too much sense to fall for any such kid
as Martha, Bob had assured her.  But how could she help
thinking about it when Wilton's father had told her that he
absolutely refused to leave his hospital work to come home for
any dance?  He was interned already, by what he called a streak
of luck, but Emily knew it was rather his ability.  And now he
was coming out to see Martha&mdash;and his father was a barber.
How could a mother help thinking about her child's matrimonial
possibilities, a lovely girl of that age?  "When I was her age,"
thought Emily, "I fell in love with Jim."  And it was because
she had been thinking of the possibility, any time now, of
Martha's marriage, that she had tolerated the painted room.
</p>

<p>
One thing Emily Kenworthy was sure of.  She had almost
gritted her teeth in the intensity of her resolutions on this
subject for years, whenever she had had to think over the
surprising course of her own life.  She had married really to
get out of this very house, made intolerable to her by the tyranny
of her aunt.  But her daughter wouldn't ever marry to get
away from her.  She would never marry for freedom!  Not
while Emily Kenworthy knew what she was doing!  Emily
had few strong convictions, but that one was unalterable.
</p>

<p>
Emily loved every meal when Martha was home.  That
evening at supper she sat cherishing her enjoyment.  Afterwards
it was so amusing to be running in and out of the painted
room, where Eve and Martha were dressing.  No sooner had
they gone up to dress, ready for the evening, than Martha
called to her from the bathroom, above the noise of water
steaming into the tub:
</p>

<p>
"Mother!"
</p>

<p>
When Emily went to her, there she stood, twinkling
importantly.
</p>

<p>
"Got a secret to tell you, mother.  Wilton said I might tell
you.  You're not to tell a soul, yet.  Not dad!"
</p>

<p>
Emily's heart gave a protesting leap.  She didn't manage to
speak indifferently.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me what it is!" she commanded.
</p>

<p>
"He's engaged, mother.  He came out to break the news to
his dad.  She's a nurse.  That's good, isn't it?  And he's crazy
as a loon about her.  He said I could tell you.  He's been
rushing that girl all summer, and his dad thinks he's working
himself to death!"  Martha smiled cynically.
</p>

<p>
What a relief!  What a fine young man that Wilton was!
Emily wished him every happiness she could think of.  Martha
didn't care a rap about him.  Of course not!  Trust Martha to
choose exactly the right man!  "Wasn't I just silly to worry
about it?" Emily thought.
</p>

<p>
The pleasure of this assurance was added to the excitement of
their preparations.  Martha looked too sweet in that simple
little flesh-colored frock.  Emily kissed her impulsively.  Eve
looked lovely, too, but one didn't just kiss Eve on the impulse,
even if she did take one's part stanchly against tender derision.
Martha had been making her mother turn round and round to
display her new gown.  "If you know the trouble I had getting
her to get it, Eve!" Martha had murmured.  "It took me all
the spring vacation to persuade her.  I never saw a human being
cling to old rags the way that woman does."  And they surveyed
her.  She was as large, almost, as the two of them, of
flowing line and generous bosom, gray-eyed, with soft brown
hair.  But her color, Martha said falsely, was ghastly.  "You're
tired out, mother.  Now stand still.  I bought this specially
for you this afternoon.  Mine don't suit you.  Now don't be
such a snob, mother.  Stop rubbing it off!  A little rouge isn't
going to corrupt your morals.  You'll come home as pure as you
went!  Mother!  Oh, you're hopeless!  When I try so hard to
make you look presentable!"  Wasn't that delicious, when one
understood it?  And wouldn't Bob have been annoyed to hear
the child's impertinence?  "Eve, look at her!" Martha begged,
tragically.  But Eve said: "Let her alone.  You'd paint a lily,
Martha.  You'd marcel Thomas Hardy himself, if you got a
chance.  You look just sweet now, Mrs. Kenworthy!"  And
they turned their attention again to their own long-considered
faces.
</p>

<p>
Martha certainly managed her adorning skillfully.  No crude
blotches of color for her.  She knew what subtly became her.
Her mother hadn't thought she used rouge until a few days
before, when she came upon her in the act.  "Why, Martha
Kenworthy!" she had protested, "where did you get that stuff?"  And
Martha, turning to Eve, had imitated her very tone fondly.
"Where did I get that stuff?  Isn't she priceless, Eve?  Isn't
she a sort of an old treasure?  I got it, to be precise, in a drug
store in Madison Avenue.  Not far from the station."  And
since then more than once she had turned her faintly tinted
cheeks naughtily up for her mother's inspection.  "Am I pure,
mammie?  Or am I painted?" she would ask.  The doubt was
scarcely as objectionable as the question.  Pure wasn't a word
girls ought to be throwing about just carelessly, it seemed to
Emily.  But both the girls failed to see her point.  "What's
the matter with 'pure,' mother?  Do you like 'virgin' better?"  They
were just naughty, trying to shock her.  And she would
do better to keep her Victorian scruples, as they called them,
to herself.
</p>

<p>
Or if she didn't want to keep them to herself, wrapped in
paper and stored away on some upper shelf, let her discard them
altogether.  That was what the dancing, balloon-entangled mass
of youth seemed to say to the Emily and Mrs. Benton who
looked down upon it that evening from the platform.  But Cora
Benton, that lordly and distinguished daughter of the American
Revolution, by her very presence retorted, as it were, "Yes!
Lay aside Victorian scruples and New England tradition.  Have
I not Georgian scruples and Illinois decorum sufficient unto the
day?"  The city band, in brand-new maroon uniforms, was
playing worse than ever, but they played&mdash;that was the point,
for they had said they would never play if wireless music was
to be chiefly used.  The mayor and the councilors looked down
on the dancers&mdash;those gentlemen who had refused to accept
this hall as a gift&mdash;determined not to admit what their eyes
saw, but unable to refrain.  The Presbyterian minister and the
Catholic priest, who planned to bless it by their presence but
momentarily, still tarried, wondering.  The representatives of
the farm bureau and the granges were trying to estimate the
number of people on the floor.  All the reluctant admirers, all
the gossipers, the obstructionists, the knockers, might stand on
that platform, and look down over that rhythmic mass, right
away to the farther side, where the dancers were swinging out
on to the wide verandas to the starlight, and back again into the
pink-shaded electric light&mdash;they might all gaze continually,
eager to find some impropriety, anxious to see, as they had
foretold, some daring lad come dripping in, in bathing suit from the
adjacent swimming-place&mdash;but in it all, nothing, nothing could
they find to shudder over.
</p>

<p>
For Mrs. Benton had reinforced herself, as it were, by the
American Legion.  He stood there with his hands in his
pockets, bull-necked, yellow-haired, low-foreheaded, somebody's
Dutch hired man.  He had redeemed the Legion from the
hands of the disreputable and he rallied about it the decent
element of the community, re-established it financially&mdash;after its
treasurers had absconded&mdash;made its dances popular again, and
started to build it a permanent home.  Mrs. Benton had wanted
her hall to have the added prestige of being a sort of memorial
to the county's soldiers.  She had laid her plan before him, and
when he had considered it and announced publicly that he had
"no use for guys that was always knocking the dames," she
thought she had persuaded him, although, really, a pretty
farmer's daughter had put into the Legion's mind thoughts
of settling down and renting a farm of his own.  So he was
weary of his public work.  Why should he devote his evenings
to running around trying to collect money when the dames
were willing to leave him free to sit close to the farmer's
daughter?  He backed Mrs. Benton to the limit of his great
ability.  He had allowed no one, of late, to "dance vulgar" at
his dances.  And now he stood on the platform with Mrs. Benton,
who knew that if he gave an order for the mayor himself
to leave the floor, the whole crowd would applaud him.  He was
the community hero.  But Mrs. Benton had no delusions about
him.  "A young Lincoln" the sentimental called him.  But she
remarked, grimly, "Easy enough to begin where Lincoln did,
in Illinois.  The trick is to finish where he finished."
</p>

<p>
The invited and distinguished guests began departing.  The
oldest G.A.R. had hobbled away, and the representatives of
the Chamber of Commerce had left the platform in a body,
giving Mrs. Benton magnanimous congratulations which she had
received but impatiently for the dancing crowd kept still
increasing, and the committee in charge of the refreshments had
summoned her to a conference.  They said cars were parked
one against the other right down to Main Street, and were
still arriving by dozens.  All the ice cream in the town had
been eaten, and a dozen freezers were on their way from the
nearest source of relief.  And as they spoke, all the women
breathed their success in deeply, wallowing in their sense of
victory.  They consulted, and they gloated.  They stood
looking down over the work of their hands, eying one another
significantly.  They said to one another, "I told you so!"  They
added, "But I never told you so much!"  Mrs. Benton and
Emily were standing together when Johnnie made his way to
the platform.  Presently Emily was standing between mother
and son.
</p>

<p>
She had been standing between mother and son intermittently
for years.
</p>

<p>
People who said that Mrs. Benton was queenly belittled her.
She was kingly.  She was nearly six feet tall&mdash;Johnnie was an
inch or two taller.  She had the neck and head of a Roman
Emperor&mdash;imperial, magnificent.  She was wearing that night a
smart black net frock, girded about and corseted as regally as
usual.  She had artificial pearls about her thick neck.  She wore,
moreover, a crown.  It was largely that coronation of great
black braids round her head that made the bobbed-hair femininity
near her seem to be bowing their insignificant heads, their thin
and modish shoulders before her like groveling subjects.  She
had a habit of pulling one of those braids up to a sort of point
exactly above the middle of her forehead, because it became
her&mdash;that is&mdash;it suggested more vividly a crown.
</p>

<p>
Seen from behind, the mother and the son were not unlike.
Johnnie had the same beautifully shaped head&mdash;and no line of
his was hidden beneath the billows of hair&mdash;beautifully set
on broad, thin shoulders.  Seen from the side, he had the
advantage of her.  He had a good chin.  If Mrs. Benton's chin
had matched her crowned forehead, democracy probably would
not have tolerated her.  Fortunately, it fell away and folded into
her neck&mdash;somewhat fatly.  But a clever observer, studying
mother and son from the front, might have guessed the sorrow
of the mother.  There was a gentleness, a sort of ease, about
the son's mouth, though a woman who had "inside information"
later called it the sweetest mouth in the world.  She said, in
fact, that it was so sweet that his false teeth looked beautiful
even in a glass of water.  He was certainly not effeminate.
How could a lad born of two male parents manage to be girlish!
He lacked what is called "push" perhaps.  The engine of his
life had not been started.  Hers was never turned off.  One
could see it pounding impatiently away as she stood there.  Her
eyes, as they looked, lorded it over the scene; when they roved
about, they reigned.  They were even now seizing upon the
scene to command it.  Johnnie looked at it and grinned, hoping
to see another pretty girl come dancing into his ken.  He was
shockingly content with the world as he found it.  Nature had
given him dancing feet, and "the dames" had made a perfect
floor for him.  The tailor made him pockets and the banker gave
him check books.  His mother had been sore with him ever
since he got home from college.  And now he had squared
himself with her by getting such a crowd to come to the
opening of the hall.  He reminded her and Emily that he deserved
credit for the multitude as he stood with them, a manicured
sum of frustration to maternal ambition.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't ask me to do anything for you if you don't
want it well done," he said to them.
</p>

<p>
For Johnnie had posted announcements of this great opening
dance on the telephone poles of six counties, rising early and
coming home from his work late practically every day for two
weeks.  This unusual industry was prompted by the most noble
filial reason possible.  He wanted to please his mother.  And he
had good reason for wanting to please her.  Emily realized that
keenly, for not more than half an hour ago she had thought she
heard some wag in the crowd around the hall whistling one of
those absurd tunes.  She wasn't sure it was one of those tunes
of Johnnie's "opera."  All tunes sound so much alike, nowadays.
But she feared it, uneasily, right in the midst of their triumph.
For this Johnnie Benton had inadvertently brought half their
club committee, as well as his mother, into humming derision.
He had held up their past to jazzy scorn.  Doggedly he insisted
that it was an accident.  He had never intended writing
a comic opera for his college class.  It had just happened.  It
never entered his head that if he wrote up one of his mother's
activities, away down East, the news of it would ever get back
home.  He acknowledged to Emily he had known that the editor
of the town daily "had it in" for the club women; that he had
been biding his time ever since they had bought the vacant
lots next to his dwelling for a parking place for the cars of the
dancers who came to their hall.  The committee had openly
regretted the necessity of doing anything to spoil the peace of his
home.  But as towns grow, apparently some provision for cars
must be made.  They had not wanted to antagonize the press.
But they had been forced to.  They had regretted it at the time,
but they had regretted it more two weeks ago.  For then, one
day&mdash;Martha had just got home from college and Johnnie
Benton was to arrive the following morning&mdash;the town had been
startled at the horrid, leering headlines:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  SCHOLASTIC HONORS OF OUR TOWNSMAN<br>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And beneath it, in smaller letters:
</p>

<p class="t4">
  VERSE ON FAMILIAR TOPICS<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Each verse was commented upon, with a sort of mock
literary criticism.
</p>

</p>

<p>
For Miss Sisson, poor old thing, who had moved in the
committee that perhaps the more elegant term of "land dressing"
might be substituted for "manure," which seemed coarse, had
made herself ridiculous at the time in the club.  And now, when
she was mourning her sister, she was made ridiculous publicly.
Well, Johnnie Benton had a great deal to answer for!  All the
women said that.
</p>

<p>
For it had happened some years after Mrs. Benton had
bought one whole freight car full of peony plants at reduced
prices and had sold them off cheap to the women of her county.
She had been driving through the western suburbs of Chicago,
and had noticed certain sterile spots that during the war had
been used as allotment gardens.  It was pitiful to her to see
those poor hard-working foreigners were still trying to grow
a few vegetables on sandy rubbish heaps.  It made her consider
what a lot of manure was piled up in the barnyards around
her town.  She laid the matter before the garden committee of
the club at once.  If every farmer's wife who had bought a
peony would give one sackful of manure, the committee would
see that it was distributed among the needy allotments of Cook
County.  The county adviser had opposed the scheme bitterly.
The Farm Bureau had condemned it.  Every ounce of manure
was needed at home, the county bulletin said.  But Mrs. Benton
asked how farmers working on their distant forties were
going to know how many sacks of manure their wives gave
away.  Did they ever count them, wasteful managers that they
were?  She would let the women know when the truck would
call for it.
</p>

<p>
But this generous plan had been balked by Johnnie and his
kind.  They said it had been all right enough to get the loan
of the family cars when they were freshmen in high school, and
to go driving about distributing peonies.  But they drew the line
at manure.  Mrs. Benton said to Emily that she had told Johnnie
he was a selfish boy, and that he had said: "Well, maybe I'm
selfish.  But I'm certainly fragrant."  Emily had never believed
Johnnie capable of that retort.  She thought his mother had
made it up for the story.  But now&mdash;well&mdash;she was beginning
to think maybe he had made it.
</p>

<p>
Johnnie had arrived home from college two days after the
headline appeared, and his mother had been ready to receive
him.  She said he had to apologize to the whole club publicly.
He refused.  And Emily was trying to arbitrate between them.
"Honestly, Mrs. Kenworthy," he said, "it never entered my
mind that you'd ever hear of it in this town.  Mother ought to
believe me when I say I wouldn't have done it for anything if
I'd known that man French was ever going to get hold of it.
I was in bad with the dean, sitting there in his office waiting to
get hauled over the coals about my work, as usual, and I
couldn't help hearing what he was saying.  He was raving.  He
told the class committee that if they couldn't get something
better than the drivel they had submitted, the annual play was
off.  I was feeling low when he got through with me, believe
me.  And I knew what I'd get at this end if I came home
flunking again.  And that night when I was lying in bed it all
came to me at once, and I got right up and wrote it down."  Johnnie
spoke now without awe of his inspiration.  "There was
the chorus of high-brow old maids singing about the need of
the poor for garden manure.  It isn't my fault they rhyme, is
it, now?  I might have said that, Mrs. Kenworthy, but you
know I never would have poked fun publicly at old Miss Sisson.
I'd never have put in about land dressing.  Would I, now?"  And
Emily, considering the shyness of the poor elegant old
thing, believed that Johnnie would have had more mercy.
"And then," he went on, "I had that chorus of farmers, regular
stage hayseeds, with long gray beards and pitchforks, resisting
them.  And the Bolshevists singing."  Johnnie hummed:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Tis the lack of horse litter<br>
  Makes poverty bitter.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"It just all does rhyme.  And I had a hero like me, refusing
to drive a truck, and eloping with a farmer's daughter in a
manure spreader.  And every farmer in the chorus was leading
a calf or a pig with him as he danced.  I told them not to have
those kids as animals.  And when the audience began to
applaud, one of the little fiends rose up on his hind legs and
began to dance.  And then they all did, of course.  The people
nearly went into spasms, they laughed so.  Oh, boy!  It was a
hot show!  I was popular for a while.  The skirts just clung to
me at the dance afterwards.  And everybody was wondering
what else might be in me.  And I was going to strike mother for
a new car the minute I got home.  Now, oh, Lordie, what a life
I lead!"
</p>

<p>
And Emily, standing as usual, between mother and son, had
maintained to Mrs. Benton that Johnnie might have been deplorably
thoughtless, but he certainly hadn't been deliberately
malicious.  How could he suppose that that man French could
get hold of it?  It was simply brutal, as Emily realized, for that
horrid person to entitle his derision "Scholastic Honors."  It
was rubbing salt into the deep wound of Cora Benton's soul.
For Johnnie most conspicuously lacked not only scholastic
honors, but even mediocre class attainments of common town
children.  He had been pulled and shoved along from one
grade to another by the skin of his teeth.  He had always been
the most careless boy in every class.  Mrs. Benton was right
when she said it was because of his health.  When he was nine
he had had infantile paralysis, and, recovering, had been sent
South.  Mrs. Benton, a passionate mother, had thrown down
her Red Cross work and taken him to a Southern town in
which a cousin of hers was living.  And that choice had
changed, she averred, the course of the boy's life.
</p>

<p>
For the White Sox had been wintering there.  And the
weary little boy, too uninterested in life to turn his thin hand
over, was carried out into the sun and coaxed into watching
them.  Some of them noticed the pale child and spoke to him.
Presently Johnnie was no longer a pitiful invalid; he had become
an active humble little mortal peeping up at the great gods who
strode about this Parnassus upon which he had been thrown.
Like an eager disciple he watched their ways.  He knew what
blessed street cars they took and at what hours.  He knew the
hallowed spot they had their hair cut.  Lying in his bed at night,
he could identify their manager's car by the sound.  In his
dreams he was steadying his arm to send a terrible curve.  His
nightmares were missed bases.  Books and reading were
forbidden him.  But at the end of that year he knew the names and
the positions of practically all the players in the League.
</p>

<p>
It took a woman like his mother to get him into the schoolhouse
the next year.  But even she could not induce his mind to
consider text-books.  By the time he was sixteen he was in a
class with thirteen-year-old boys, and he looked small and
delicate among them.  And then he began growing.  His heart
was weak.  He got pneumonia.  The doctor said he would
never be well unless he was taken out of school again and let
"run wild."  The year Bronson came to his Aunt Emily,
Mrs. Benton spent part of the winter in New Mexico and moved
from there because she couldn't endure the sight of her son
playing ball with lazy Mexicans whom he had inspired to the
game.  She went to a vineyard in California, and there she had
to see him rally enough young Japs for his nine.  She left him
that summer on a ranch in Arizona, safe from a baseball
atmosphere, she supposed.  He found a camp of Boy Scouts by
riding not too many score of miles, and played with them till
he came back in the autumn, less inclined to sit at a desk than
ever before, and much stronger physically.  And if people said
truly that only Mrs. Benton's incorrigible determination had
kept that boy alive to grow into a strong man, they might also
have said the same force finally got him into college.  And all he
had ever done there, as she remarked bitterly to Emily, who
condoned his accidental operatic career, was to short-stop for
the second nine, and make his mother ridiculous in that
disgusting "opera."
</p>

<p>
And now, Johnnie, having put in a good word for himself,
having diplomatically repeated every complimentary remark he
had heard all the evening about the extraordinary superiority
of the floor, intended going back to his play.  Mrs. Benton
kept him standing there, however.  Emily wondered if she
had determined to have the whole town see mother and son
chatting pleasantly together.  For the whole town, like Emily
Kenworthy, often wondered, too curiously, exactly what the
relationship between the two was.  Mrs. Benton kept her own
counsel like the proverbially close-lipped male.  People could
only imagine what she thought of Johnnie's dancing every
evening at the country club from which she had withdrawn in
rage.  The elders were known to have welcomed her withdrawal
like a gift from heaven.  The young fry, it was commonly
said, couldn't have a single dance without Johnnie, who
danced "divinely."  (Martha Kenworthy had said once, holding
a long-legged columbine swaying in her hand, that it looked
exactly like Johnnie Benton.)  He was hail-fellow-well-met to
most of his mother's sworn enemies.  Emily sometimes thought I
that must require determination almost equal to his mother's.
He just simply was a "nice boy," the town said.  He had a
good disposition, and Bob Kenworthy was not the only one who,
saying that, added, "And the Lord knows he needed it!"
</p>

<p>
"Whoever could have believed it?" Emily was saying.
"Where have they all come from?" they were thinking
together.  You could count the faces you knew.  The youth of
the town had been pushed aside by the youth of the whole
state, apparently.  In a way, the very success was failure, for
the committee had enlarged their plans time after time to
provide against this indecent modern crowding.  And now
people were simply wriggling about like fishing worms thick
in a can.  Suddenly:
</p>

<p>
"EMILY!" exclaimed Cora Benton.  "WHAT'S MARTHA
DOING?"  Sharply she had spoken, commandingly.
</p>

<p>
"Martha?" exclaimed Emily, shocked.  "Where?  I don't
see her."  She had scarcely seen her all evening.
</p>

<p>
"Over there.  Look!"  She pointed with her eye to the
farther side of the crowd, where it was overflowing to the
veranda.
</p>

<p>
Johnnie said&mdash;he spoke shortly, "She's dancing!"
</p>

<p>
"Well!  Well!  Maybe she is."  Mrs. Benton was condoning
already her tone of reproof.
</p>

<p>
But Emily had at first sight thought it appropriate, because&mdash;well,
what in the world WAS Martha doing?  Emily had fairly
started with annoyance when she saw her.  To her first glance
it was disgusting.  And then, as she looked, chagrined,
perplexed,&mdash;well&mdash;it wasn't disgusting.  Really, perhaps, the
position in which Martha and her partner were obviously worming
their way about was not one which, after long deliberations on
the subject, the committee had thought best to forbid on the
floor.  It was that man&mdash;his face&mdash;the way he was bending
down, being tall, to look at her.  It was, most of all, Emily
realized in a flash, angrily, the way Martha was holding her
sweet little face, entranced, up to him.  What in the world were
those two talking about?
</p>

<p>
"Who is that man?" Emily asked Johnnie.  She was too
annoyed to observe how keenly Johnnie was watching the sight.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  Never saw him before."
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing we can take exception to in THAT!"  Mrs. Benton
seemed almost to regret the fact.
</p>

<p>
Johnnie looked at her indignantly and ineffectively.
</p>

<p>
Emily resented the suggestion sharply.  The very idea that
anyone might take exception to her daughter, that the committee
might disapprove of her child's attitude, hurt her deeply.  For
Martha Kenworthy was distinctly a nice girl.  Everybody had
always known that she was a very superior, quiet, well-behaved,
dear child.  Mothers consulted her mother about their naughty
children.  And now Cora Benton&mdash;but just the same, it did
look as if Martha in that little flesh-colored frock, was almost
cuddling up against&mdash;that&mdash;somebody&mdash;whom Emily at first
shocked sight heartily disliked.
</p>

<p>
"Go and tell her I want to see her."  Emily spoke to Johnnie
and regretted it.  Mrs. Benton let no one know when she
corrected her son.  But Emily Kenworthy's intention of reproving
her daughter was revealed to the world.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't say anything to her.  Look, there's a couple&mdash;lots
of them are dancing that way.  It does leave something to
be desired," Cora Benton counseled.
</p>

<p>
"I hadn't thought of saying anything about that to her,"
Emily said, carelessly.  She was surprised at the sharpness of
her resentment.  After all, hadn't she often told even Cora
Benton how to manage her child!
</p>

<p>
It seemed a long time before Johnnie came back, more or
less dutifully.  She suspected him of having had several dances
in the meantime.
</p>

<p>
"I can't find her," he reported.  "It's like a needle in a
haystack.  The river is as crowded as the floor.  Pete McGill
says this is the largest crowd that was ever in this town.  He
says there are five hundred more cars than there were on
Armistice Day.  I'll keep my eye open for her.  They're not
allowing any more cars across the bridge.  Would I do&mdash;for
what you wanted her for?"
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter," said Emily.  "It wasn't anything, really,
thank you."
</p>

<p>
But it was something, when presently she saw Martha again,
dancing that same way, with that same man, listening with her
face tilted up to him exactly as before.  It made Emily think
of the time Martha had sat absorbed before some story that
Jim Kenworthy wove fantastically for her.  That man&mdash;he
must be an old friend.  Emily racked her memory.  Some
girl's older brother, would it be, or some household where
Martha had stayed?  She tried to fit him in, and as she watched
the two, she saw Martha suddenly sort of double down with
amusement, shrugging her shoulders, chuckling, while the man,
encouraged, peered more boldly into her face.
</p>

<p>
"I'll put an end to that!" Emily said.  And she hurried down
and sought out a place from which she might catch Martha's
eye.  It was difficult to catch an eye so intent upon its interest.
She waited persistently till she had got her attention, and
signified to her that she wanted to speak to her at once.
</p>

<p>
Martha came to her presently&mdash;alone&mdash;on to the platform,
flushed, shining, unashamed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mother!" she ejaculated.  She sighed with unspeakable
satisfaction.  "What a night!  Could you have believed it!"
</p>

<p>
But Emily said, "Martha, who was that awful man you were
dancing with?"
</p>

<p>
Her tone surprised Martha.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said, "that was Sandy.  You know Sandy Powers.
I had to dance with him.  He was in my high school&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean <i>him</i>!  I know Sandy!  I mean that dark person
you had this last dance with!"
</p>

<p>
Martha gave a giggle of amusement.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know who <i>that</i> was?" she demanded.  She
seemed to think it a great joke.  "Why, mother, that's Eve's
brother-in-law!"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know her brother-in-law was here.  When did he
come?"
</p>

<p>
"He just came to-day.  I thought, of course, she would have
introduced him.  Oh, mother, he's an interesting man.  He's
been everywhere.  I'll bring him over to you."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like him!"
</p>

<p>
Emily ruffled was so rare a sight that Martha seemed to
enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you will when you've seen him.  You don't know
him," she assured her mother, critically, and adjusted a little
lock of hair.
</p>

<p>
"Is his wife here?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I don't suppose so."
</p>

<p>
"Well," grumbled Emily, "don't be dancing with him all
evening.  Where's Johnnie?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't danced with him all evening!  We've had two
dances."  Martha was really surprised.
</p>

<p>
Emily felt she had been foolish.  "Oh, all right," she said,
lightly.  "I thought I didn't know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Martha studied her.
</p>

<p>
"I promised him another.  Oh, he dances divinely!  You're
tired out, mother.  Have you been working every minute?
Why don't you go home?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I'm staying till the end to-night.  I'm not going
home."  She might have added, "I'm not going to leave you."
</p>

<p>
But the evening had wilted for her.  The hours dragged on.
Bob came to her at one.  Even Bob was full of congratulations.
"You ought to be satisfied, old girl," he said.  "I heard Wilkinson
say that you ought to have credit for the whole thing.  He
said really if it hadn't been for you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Where's Martha?  Have you seen her?"
</p>

<p>
"I saw her a while ago, up at the house.  She had a new
Johnnie in tow."
</p>

<p>
"Who?  A large dark man?"
</p>

<p>
And Bob, struck with an idea, said, "Well, if he's Eve's
brother-in-law, he must be a married man."
</p>

<p>
"He certainly must!"
</p>

<p>
Bob turned and looked at her.
</p>

<p>
"He wasn't acting particularly married."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Where's his wife?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I don't even know whether she's here or
not.  I told Martha not to dance with him again!"
</p>

<p>
"She's minding as she usually does!" Bob commented.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you stay at the house?"
</p>

<p>
"They didn't seem to want me.  Let's go home, Emily.  Cut
out the rest of it."
</p>

<p>
"No.  I'm staying to-night until the end.  We all are."
</p>

<p>
They were home again, finally, towards morning, sinking
down deeply into the living-room cushions, spreading themselves
out, breathing out great sighs of contentment.  Emily,
on the sofa, was adjusting hairpins in the coils of her brown
hair.  Eve sat beside her, resting in the position she had fallen
into, her legs stretched out, her skirts up to her knees, her
thin arms extended limply, with dark little frail-looking
shadows beneath her eyes.  Martha had paused to adjust her
color before the hall mirror, and then seated herself, fresh as
a morning flower, erect in an easy chair, her hands crossed in
her lap, her shoulders tilted slightly, light from the hall on the
smoothness of her black hair, dreaming, slight, detached.
When her father, who had insisted on going to the kitchen to
make lemonade, called out to Emily to know where the sugar
had been put, Martha, realizing, as it were, the group, joined
them without excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Sit still, Eve.  Don't go and get it for him.  It's sitting
just where it has sat ever since I was born, and he can't help
seeing it.  Well, anyway, you ought to be content, mother.  It's
really your hall, and everyone knows it.  Where'd Mrs. Benton
been, everybody wants to know, if it hadn't been for you?
Johnnie's just like her.  He makes me tired.  He went about
saying he'd got all that crowd there by his old posters.  I told
him it would have been a lot nicer party if he hadn't got so
many to come."
</p>

<p>
Bob came in just then, Martha's prophecy having been fulfilled
about the sugar.  He heard Eve's remark: "I think the
Legion was by far the most interesting man there.  I offered to
dance with him.  He takes himself seriously, of course."
</p>

<p>
Bob was feeling facetious.
</p>

<p>
"You needn't set your heart on that man, Eve.  What he
wants is a wife that'll do the midnight milking.  Yes, midnight!
Didn't you even know the farmers around here milk four times
a day?  To get more milk, of course.  Twice at twelve, and
twice at six.  That's the kind he is.  And say, Martha, can't
you get a single man to lead around?  Eve's sister will be
pulling your hair the next thing you know."
</p>

<p>
Emily spoke up hastily.
</p>

<p>
"Was your sister there, Eve?  I didn't see her.  Where do
they live?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  She isn't well.  They're like the rest of us.  They
don't live any place."  She spoke reluctantly, and then, as if
she felt that something more was expected of her, she added:
"They have been abroad awhile.  In Paris, mostly."
</p>

<p>
But Martha took up Bob's challenge.  "He's so distinguished,"
she drawled.  "Doesn't he dance divinely, Eve?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," Eve replied, shortly.  "I don't dance with
him."  And then she added, abruptly, "Look here, Martha,
you needn't dance with him to please me!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry about that.  I dance with him to please myself.
You ought to hear him talk, mother.  He's got the loveliest
foreign accent, hasn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Hasn't he!  And he was brought up in Indiana!" Eve murmured.
</p>

<p>
"He's been everywhere.  I'm going abroad myself next
summer.  He knew Tchekhoff.  He was telling me about him."
</p>

<p>
Eve sat up.  Her eyes narrowed shrewdly.  "That's a new
one to me," she commented.  "I don't believe it."  The silence
became awkward.  She broke it abruptly.  "He's a four-flusher,
Martha.  Take it from me.  From the ground up.  If he
ever saw a Russian in Paris, he'd have known Tolstoy himself,
and been bosom friend with Dostoieffsky.  He's a journalist,
to put it mildly."
</p>

<p>
It was painful, this way Eve had of saying nasty things
about her relations, as if it were a noble duty.  She had
spoken so doggedly that her face was flushed an unbecoming
dark red.  Martha grew pinker.  The silence grew longer.
Emily said, carelessly, rising:
</p>

<p>
"What pests these in-laws are!  Let's go to bed.  You've
ripped your hem, Martha.  Did you know it?  You're both to
sleep till noon."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you worry about that!" Bob jeered.
</p>

<p>
But Eve replied: "I've got to be home for lunch.  Dad's
going to be home."
</p>

<p>
If Emily didn't sleep at once, it wasn't because from the
painted room came those stifled whispers and gigglings which
so often annoyed Bob after dances.  The girls seemed to have
gone to sleep at once.  But Emily kept thinking about Martha,
and Mrs. Benton's sharp voice.  The man, of course, would be
leaving town at once.  What would a journalist from Paris, a
friend of Tchekhoff find to amuse him in a little Illinois city?
And supposing he chose to stay all the summer, Martha could be
trusted.  She had such common sense.  And such good taste,
always.  "It's just silly of me to worry about Martha," Emily
thought, not once only but many times, till she was thoroughly
tired of her foolish, wide-awake mind.  "Thank goodness it's
over!" she said to herself again and again.  "Thank goodness
that chapter's ended!"
</p>

<p>
A long interesting chapter had indeed ended that evening,
more suddenly than Emily realized.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
<i>Chapter Three</i>
</h3>

<p>
The next day at first seemed like any other morning of the
year, for Emily didn't get up as early as she had intended.  There
still was heavy dew lying on the thick greenness of the lawn
when she sat down on the veranda to finish pitting the cherries.
Afterwards she pattered about in the kitchen, tending the ruby
mixture in the kettle till her cheeks were rosy red.  And then
she had filled the Mason jars, and screwed on the lids, and
tested their inverted security, one by one, and put them in
rows on the shelf to cool, interrupted from time to time by
friends at the 'phone who must count over one by one the
evening's triumphs.  She was busy thinking that she really
must take those fresh sash curtains up to the bathroom&mdash;it was
scandalous, the condition of those hanging there&mdash;when the
boy brought the raspberries she had ordered&mdash;far the best
ones she had seen all the season.  The girls, she thought,
would love them for their breakfast.  She prepared two saucerfuls,
and got the pitcher of cream ready on the tray, and went
up towards their room.  Of course that was the way, Bob
said, she spoiled Martha, always waiting on her, carrying
something delicious up to her in the middle of the morning, when
the girl ought to have been up and doing all the housework
herself.  Bob couldn't understand what a child Martha was,
how unfit yet for responsibility.  Wait till she had a house
of her own.  Just think of that painted room of hers, for
instance.  That showed what the child could do when she
wanted to.
</p>

<p>
Emily opened the painted door quietly.  On a day bed at
one end of the room Eve was lying on her back reading, in
sea-green figured silk pajamas which must have cost a good
deal, one knee crossed over the other.  Books were piled
on the floor beside her, nearly as high as her low pillow.
</p>

<p>
She turned her head, and caught sight of the tray, and gave
a shriek of delight.  She called to Martha, who lay asleep on
her bed-like device at the other end of the room, curled up
like a child, not even a sheet over her.  And Martha, sitting up
in flesh-colored voile pajamas on the edge of the bed,
stretching, yawning, pink and sweet, began:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you rare lamb, mother!  Isn't she a gem, Eve?  No
wonder dad says she spoils me!  Where did you get them?"  Eve
had put a low table at Martha's side, and seated herself
on the other side of it.  But Emily maturely sought out the
chair that was kept in the room as a concession to her dislike
of floor cushions.  She sat watching them gobble daintily,
chattering away.  Martha, who had made herself comfortable
against a pile of cushions, her knees drawn up, and the saucer
balancing on them, began wiggling her toes.  She hadn't
outgrown that infant habit yet, Emily enjoyed noticing.  How she
had watched this child's awakening with an impulse of delight
every day, almost from her first week, till this morning, when
she woke even yet delicately rosy and vividly red-lipped.  Poor
old Bob never got any fun out of it.  Martha had disturbed
him by waking too early, for years, and now she annoyed him
by sleeping too late.  But Emily wouldn't stop to sigh long
over that, not these few summer mornings when she could
enjoy it, now that the child was grown, and away months
together.  And just then Martha almost unconsciously bestirred
herself and with the saucer in one hand and the spoon in the
other, almost without ceasing to feed herself, went and pulled
down a blind to shut the glare of the sunshine away from that
rug of hers that tended to look too violently cerise.  The girl, it
seemed, couldn't sit up in bed eating berries for breakfast
without thinking how the room might look if she should change
it just a little.
</p>

<p>
It sobered Emily to see the ancestry driving her defenseless
daughter hither and thither like a slave.  Would it not be
ironical, now, if this girl "turned out" like that aunt whom
Emily's childhood had so futilely resented!  It seemed to Emily
that never in her young days had that house been free a
week from the sound of hammers or the smell of paint.  She
had wondered, sometimes, in her maturity, whether she turned
instinctively away from the thought of "improving" her house
because she had so continually in her childhood revolted against
her aunt, or whether it was simply laziness that made her
tolerate any closet shelf, however inconvenient, rather than
bestir herself to alter it.  Since she had inherited the house,
it had had peace.  She had merely kept it in repair, and
tolerated the electric devices with which Bob filled it.  But now,
looking at Martha, she saw again all her aunt's zeal for change
overflowing again.
</p>

<p>
She had not suspected the child of any such constructive
inclinations until one day of the last Christmas vacation.  They
had been talking carelessly together, when suddenly she had
heard:
</p>

<p>
"Do you know what I'm going to do the first thing, mammie,
as soon as I get my money?"
</p>

<p>
That was a question naturally never far from Emily's mind
then, because in fifteen months Martha would be twenty, and,
according to the terms of her great-aunt's will, she would then
receive the first monthly installment of an income of nearly
four thousand dollars.  Emily had hated that will when she
first heard its terms, because it had been drawn up, she
understood, so as to keep the least control of the money away from
Bob Kenworthy.  Exactly what grounds her aunt had had for
these suspicions, Emily never knew.  She could have
discovered only by asking her husband, and it was the very
essence of her character that she would not ask him.  The very
vagueness of that suspicion had been a wound that years of
Bob's respectability and kindness had healed.  He had not
complained about the will at first&mdash;Emily had wondered why
he had not.  Did he not dare?  But now that the child had
grown up, without much regard for him, he thought it
outrageous that that old woman should have made her independent
of him.  Emily herself, who loved ease with all her heart, who
was no manager, in the local sense of the term, had tried
faithfully to prepare her daughter to use her money wisely&mdash;if not
wisely, exactly, at least not too foolishly at first.  So when
Martha brought up the subject, her mother had asked her once,
curiously:
</p>

<p>
"What will be the first thing you do with it?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll chuck all that junk out of my bedroom and do it all
over."
</p>

<p>
Emily had been shocked, but she had to smile presently; for
wasn't that the very thing she had done first herself, when she
had returned to the house after her aunt's death?  To be sure,
she had later brought down from the attic the old pieces she
had especially hated in her childhood.  But she remembered
with what joy she had stored them away, how she had taken
off shutters, and thrown away faded carpets, and gloried in
rugs.  But Martha's was rather unreasonable, for her bedroom
Emily had furnished only six years ago, and most daintily.
She had given Martha some of the best things in the house; a
dear little chest of drawers that had been before in the spare
room, and two little old tables, and gone to great pains to get a
bed to suit them.  And Martha now had called it "junk"!
</p>

<p>
"What sort of furniture would you get?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh mother&mdash;it doesn't matter."  Martha was apologetic.
"You wouldn't let me, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know I wouldn't?" Emily had retorted.  "I
don't know that I'm so tyrannical!"
</p>

<p>
"I never said you were any such thing.  But you know,
mother, you'd just sort of persuade me to get what you liked."
</p>

<p>
"Why Martha!  Maybe I would let you get what you wanted!"
</p>

<p>
Martha went on with the subject hesitatingly.  She spoke
wistfully, but without hope.
</p>

<p>
"I'd throw all that junk out and paint it all over.  I'd do
the floor a nice dull bluey purple&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"A purple floor?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  And the woodwork I'd do all creamy yellow, like
good fresh butter, or a sort of sea green."
</p>

<p>
"But, Martha, that floor's <i>oak</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Oak takes paint."
</p>

<p>
"Mine doesn't."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm just saying what I <i>would</i> do if it was mine.  I
knew you wouldn't let me.  I'd get a little pine chest made, to
paint just like my little old one.  Oh, wouldn't I love to do it,
though!  The girls have such lovely rooms, mother.  You
ought to see Grace Richmond's.  It's all vermilion and blue.
But she's an orphan, of course."  Martha sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Martha!" Emily had exclaimed, "what a lot you have
to look forward to!  You'll be an orphan some day, and you
can paint the whole house purple!"
</p>

<p>
"Now, mammie, that's just plain nasty of you.  You egged
me on to say what I would do, and now you make fun of me!"  But
Martha, mollified, had gone on to tell of the staggering
sights she had seen in other girls' homes, reeling colors,
threatening emerald ceilings, and cubistic ornamentations.
</p>

<p>
And Emily had pondered the matter, Martha's sigh rankling.
"Her room is all vermilion and blue.  But she's an orphan, of
course."  Did her child, in spite of her mother's long
determination to the contrary, feel hampered, thwarted of joy by
parental preferences?  Was she getting eager to get out of the
home, away some place to freedom, as her mother had run
once?  After all, that floor wasn't so very valuable, and the
paper needed renewing.  Martha wouldn't be at home
months together now, to get tired of her gaudiness.  It wouldn't
cost such a lot, and no one would have to see it.  The door
into the outer hall could be kept shut.
</p>

<p>
A day or two later she had said:
</p>

<p>
"Do you know what I'm going to give you for your birthday?"
</p>

<p>
Martha guessed extravagantly:
</p>

<p>
"A car, mammie?  A little runabout to take back to school?"
</p>

<p>
"Not much!  I'm going to let you do your bedroom over to
suit yourself."
</p>

<p>
And Martha had looked blank for a moment, and then
murmured:
</p>

<p>
"Oh no!  It wouldn't do, mother.  We couldn't.  We'd&mdash;mother&mdash;we'd
<i>quarrel</i>, as sure as you live.  I'd get started,
and I'd want my own way, and you wouldn't approve."
</p>

<p>
"But I say I <i>will</i> approve.  After all, it's <i>your</i> room.  <i>I</i> don't
have to live in it.  You can have it blue and vermilion, if you
want to!"
</p>

<p>
And Martha had sat there for a moment without saying a
word, her eyes beginning to twinkle, her dimples all chuckling,
just shining and beaming, all her pleasure intensified by her
quietness.  Then she had hugged Emily after that and had
run up to her room straight away.  And up and down she ran,
hunting for scissors, for yardsticks, measuring, planning,
'phoning to carpenters, twinkling, utterly happy.  It had been
Emily's sense of her utter happiness that had enabled her to
stifle her impulses to interfere.
</p>

<p>
Once things had got rather serious.  The child wouldn't
have a bed in the room.  She wanted to turn it into a sitting
room.  And when Emily had pointed out that she didn't need
a sitting room, Martha had hugged her and, warningly, "I
told you we'd quarrel, mother!"  Emily had given way, and
Martha had gone on, working like a beaver.  She had dyed,
and she had shopped in Chicago; she had "jollied" painters
whole mornings, and gone back to school in the end, leaving
her mother sewing balls of silken high-brow carpet rags.  Her
very letters had been full of instructions about the room.  And
during her spring vacation the whole house seemed to be an
orgy of renewal, so that Martha hadn't been far wrong when
she said that her mother only endured her nowadays through
gritted teeth.  She had said it from her "studio" in the attic,
where she was painting tables, for there alone could she be
found that holiday.  She had planned so well that in that
fortnight she had almost completed her purposes, and she had
hated leaving it to go back to college.  And to that room she
had flown home again, not eager, as she generally was, to go
away for the summer.  Not once had she mentioned the
Rockies or Canada, or even Europe.  And her heart was so
absorbed in it that now, on awakening to raspberries and cream,
she had to go and adjust that blind and study the way the light
fell on the cerise&mdash;practically&mdash;rug.
</p>

<p>
And Emily looked around, and smiled cautiously.  It had
been the girl's idea to make the room "amusing."  That was
the adjective she had continually used of her plan.  And
certainly she had succeeded in inciting mirth at least in the elders
who beheld it.  To be sure, with the blind down, the darkly
gleaming floor wasn't so bad after one had got used to it.  The
sand-colored walls were matched by woodwork with little green
lines on it.  And the rosy silken oval rugs and those black day
beds&mdash;hateful objects, which kept the edges of the bedding
always on the floor, piled by day with cushions like shrieking
parrots&mdash;all this was almost laughable.  She had told Martha
firmly the beds ought to be side by side between the windows.
But Martha ignored the suggestion.  The bookshelves had
absurd little cupboards at each end, which Martha opened to
show her friends, and an electric stove on a little tray which
you stood, so, on this little shelf which pulled out, so.  She
had gathered a primitive sort of crockery bowls from New
York, which were called "just too quaint," and the coffee
things from the Chicago Ghetto.  Emily had almost protested
against this miniature kitchen.  Martha never would be making
fudge up there, she was sure.  But then she had got to
thinking of Martha's outgrown playhouse under the willow.  "I
used to let her have dishes and everything out there," she
remembered.  And she had not only stifled her objections;
she had come heartily to admire this adolescent playhouse.
</p>

<p>
For there, opening off this room, was the amazing dressing
room Martha had made from that large closet where formerly
clothes had hung drably.  People in the town used to say
that, for the sake of having daylight in that closet and preserving
the symmetry of the outside of the house, Emily's aunt had
torn out and built over that wall seven times.  Now Emily
had to take visitors up to see that closet, many and insistent
visitors, for all Martha's chums were bringing their mothers
enviously to show them "Martha's apartment."  When she
heard their exclamations, she would look at her daughter
with that feeling which she experienced when the child, blowing
her horn, adjusting her brakes, watching the traffic "cop," drove
that panting great headstrong car so calmly, without hurrying
one eyelash, through the tangle of vehicles of any city that
might lie in her path.  For Martha quietly had taken that long
narrow closet and lined it on both mirrored sides with
hanging wardrobes, and a great total and variety of cunningly
planned shelves, shallow and deep drawers, great and small,
pulling out on patent rollers; she had packed away a beautifully
lighted dressing table, with a stool that pushed back
into its own "ducky nook."  She had painted all the drawers a
dull gold on the inside, and a creamy yellow on the outside,
and made them gold knobs and handles.  The purple floor
and the glow of the rug, less violent than those of the larger
room, left her visitors quite mad with envy and surprise.
</p>

<p>
"It's just Martha all over!" one girl sighed, and Emily had
pondered that.  Was Martha then to be a lover of perfect
places to stow away things?  There had been plenty of drawers
and closets in the house before, Emily had said to herself.
And when she had seen the child's delight in that huge big
topmost drawer, she had let her have a great pile of old soft
pieced quilts to pack away in it, just as she had given her
old hats years before for the games in the willow playhouse.
Was that dressing closet "just Martha all over"?  Was the
child going to be an architect, as she had carelessly suggested
once, or an "interior decorator," possibly?  Perhaps she was
yet going to be brilliant, and do many things as successfully as
she had done this, so that Bob would yet be proud of her.  Or
perhaps she was going to be a furious housewife, delighting in
a family of children.  And Emily grew serious thinking of
that.  She had every reason to distrust too great interest in
housekeeping.  She would see that Martha never loved furniture
more than children's ease of mind, never put order of a
room before its usefulness.  She did hope Martha wouldn't
carry these things to excess, as her heredity might urge her to.
Here the child hadn't got all the rugs for this room home from
the woman who was making them, and she had already begun
to talk about enlarging the garage.  It disfigured the whole
house, as it was, she had told her father.  If she might be
allowed to double the size of it, making room for two cars&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Then Bob had interrupted: "I'm not going to keep two cars!"
</p>

<p>
"But <i>I'll</i> have a car next year," she had suggested.
</p>

<p>
"You don't <i>need</i> a car!" Bob had asserted, hotly.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe I don't," Martha had answered, softly, infuriatingly,
for her lazily lifted eyes had added, defiantly, "But I'm going
to have one, anyway!"
</p>

<p>
"If I could add another part to the garage and change that
hideous entrance so we could hide it with some&mdash;lilacs
and&mdash;things, mother, then I could change the west window of my
room into a door, and have the whole roof of the garage for
a veranda of my own, with an adjustable awning kind of over
it, and some roses up the supports of it.  And how much nicer
it would be in the summer to sit there without a roof over us.
We'd get all the breeze there was there, don't you think,
mammie?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Martha, give us a rest.  Let's have some peace.
There's no reason why you should have a car, I tell you,
anyway at your age."  Thus Bob received her suggestion.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to think it all over," Emily had replied.  It
would have to stop some place.  Martha couldn't just be allowed
to "express herself" all over the house whenever it suited her
fancy.  If Bob would only stop threatening to forbid her to
use his car, maybe she wouldn't insist so frequently on having
one of her own next year.
</p>

<p>
The raspberries stimulated Martha to action, for she dressed
as Eve and Emily sat discussing the evening.  She had to go
and get some flowers for her room, before her guests came, she
said, departing.  And Eve began spreading those day beds into
order.  Emily bestirred herself to help.  She had a notion to
move those beds into the middle of the room together.  But
she refrained.  She had to reflect that, though Martha decorated
with fury, she dusted with less zeal.  In that, too, she resembled
her mother.  She returned presently with her hands full of
lilacs for her red-copper bowls.  She threw them down on
the bed and when Emily suggested arranging them she said,
"Wait, mother.  I've 'phoned Johnnie to get me some blue
ones from the high-school garden."  Emily began a faint
protest, knowing Mrs. Benton didn't allow anyone to gather
the flowers of that young hedge of hybrid lilacs which she had
given to the high school.  Martha said: "Oh, I wanted one or
two.  Mother, we've just got to have a place in the garden for
a very late lilac like that, because it makes the bouquets for
this room."  And Johnnie came in immediately.  With half
a dozen great blossoms right up the stairs he walked, and into
that&mdash;no, it wasn't a bedroom, but it still seemed strange to
have him making himself at home among the bedrooms.
Martha scolded him for bringing so many branches, but she had
to have at least two of those dark purply ones.  "You can see
that for yourself," she insisted to Johnnie.  Emily could see it
for herself.  The flow of color melted and shifted about those
darkest blues as Martha lowered one shade and pushed up
another, grumbling because mignonette couldn't be got to bloom
earlier.  If she had ever thought those delphiniums would
have been all crushed up that way the first dance last night,
she would have saved some for her room.
</p>

<p>
Emily had told Johnnie to hand her the pile of books that
lay on the floor beside Eve's bed.  Eve, to judge from the
literature with which she surrounded herself continually,
couldn't enjoy one book unless there were ten others as good
waiting at her elbow for their turn.  She came out of the
dressing room while Johnnie was looking over the books he
had put on the shelf for Emily.
</p>

<p>
He said, "Hello!  You still here?"
</p>

<p>
"You can't say anything.  You're here again."
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> was invited.  <i>I</i> was 'phoned for."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm leaving soon, and that's more than you're likely
to do."
</p>

<p>
"I'm expecting to be kicked out any minute," he replied,
looking at Emily.  "Nobody appreciates me here.  Is this any
good?" he asked, carelessly fingering a book.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
He read the name out.  Emily stood listening.  It was the
book that had shocked her so entirely years ago&mdash;the book
about which she and Jim Kenworthy had quarreled so
destructively.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you read that?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I've heard of it."
</p>

<p>
"How intellectual of you!  They make you read it, in most
schools, that is, if you're interested in technique.  You'd call
it a thousand miles of sand.  I haven't got any Robert
Chambers," Eve went on, looking over possibilities.  "You
might try Michael Arlen, there.  His style would be lost on
you, but the subject would appeal to your heart.  There's
the Kreutzer Sonata.  Have you read <i>Crime and Punishment</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't stand Russian stuff."
</p>

<p>
"Does seem difficult, after the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>," Eve
remarked.  Skirts may have clung to Johnnie, but Eve wasn't
one of them.  She had commented, on hearing of his masterpiece,
that its music was hackneyed, the verse was rot and the
theme disgusting.  Martha had retorted that the theme, rather,
was rot.  Johnnie and Eve quarreled on till Eve departed.
</p>

<p>
"You're going to stay for lunch, Johnnie?" Emily asked.
</p>

<p>
"I won't if you don't want me to."
</p>

<p>
"How truly magnanimous!" Emily murmured.  "No.  You
stay and talk to the girls, but don't stay for lunch.  You know
your mother wants you."  Emily wondered then, and she
wondered later, why Martha had wanted Johnnie to stay.  Did
she want him to hear what the Wright girls' mother was sure
to say about the dressing room?  Did Martha care really what
Johnnie thought&mdash;Johnnie, who was always asking her to marry
him?
</p>

<p>
And what <i>did</i> he think, as he stood lazily leaning against the
door into the dressing room, watching the women examine the
drawers?  Mrs. Wright had brought with her a friend who was
planning a new house, a prosperous-looking person, and who
listened thoughtfully to Martha's answers to her questions.
This person was impressed.  She kept looking at Martha when
they were seated at length in the painted room.
</p>

<p>
"How much of this did you do yourself?" she asked.
"Hadn't you seen something like it somewhere?"
</p>

<p>
Martha was sitting on a cushion at Emily's feet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes.  I'd seen one in New York.  And I just told the
old Dane, the carpenter, how many drawers I wanted, and how
big, and he did it all himself.  I couldn't measure them, or
anything like that.  He had them all ready to put in when I
got home.  I'd like to do over all the closets in the house."  She
looked at her mother, against whom she was leaning.
</p>

<p>
The guests looked at Emily.  She had to say something.
</p>

<p>
"But if all the closets in this house had so many drawers, we
wouldn't have enough to put into them."
</p>

<p>
"I know it.  Isn't that funny?"  Martha turned to the
other.  "People are so silly.  The closets are so big there's
nothing to fill them with.  Same way with our basement.  It's
a horror!"  Martha spoke with such conviction that her hearers
laughed.  "Well, it is," she insisted to Emily.  "There's a
wood room and a coal room, and drying room, and storeroom
with nothing but the hose and two old barrels in it.  I could put
all those things into one room nicely, and have three great big
rooms.  They could be billiard rooms, or play rooms, or nice
workshops.  If I had a lot of children in this house I could
give them all two rooms apiece."
</p>

<p>
Emily included Johnnie in her glance.  He had his eyes fixed
hard on Martha&mdash;who avoided them innocently but persistently.
</p>

<p>
And that thoughtful and prosperous-looking stranger said:
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't you like to drive over and look at my plans?
Our basement is going to cost an awful lot."
</p>

<p>
Martha twinkled at the invitation.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I just love to look at plans!" she said.  "I just love to
think about people's houses.  I was thinking, if ever I'm a
reformer, do you know what I'm going to reform?  Everybody's
closets!"
</p>

<p>
Wasn't she lovely, sitting there innocently, Emily thought.
No wonder they admired her, all of them.
</p>

<p>
"You come and reform all my closets," the stranger said.
But Mrs. Wright said: "Don't look at mine till I've had a
chance to go over them.  You've made me a lot of trouble,
Martha.  The girls won't give me a minute's peace now till I
let them start doing their rooms over."
</p>

<p>
When Emily, having dismissed the visitors, turned from the
hall into her living room, the sight of these familiar things
almost shocked her.  They stirred her, at least, to question
the very room she had for years taken for granted.  The
glamour of that room upstairs seemed to make the rest of the
house faded, some way.  The living room she had always sat
down in with satisfaction.  Now it
looked&mdash;timid&mdash;meager&mdash;insipid&mdash;unexpectant.  Its walls and
its woodwork were almost
the color of its neutral light pongee curtains.  Those were
good rugs on the oak floor.  They were rich, and they were
mellow.  Emily had bought them recklessly with a large share
of the first installment of her inheritance, when she had moved
back to the house when Martha was a small girl, and she had
never regretted her fling.  The davenport and the two chairs
that went with it, those most comfortable monstrosities, had
been done once in blue corduroy.  Well, it was still corduroy.
That was about all that could be said for it.  But its blue
dullness some way had seemed to match the rugs.  That was a
good table.  No one bought a table like that in any town in
Illinois.  Nor was there a desk like that, which plainly had been
cherished for some generations.  And how infinitely superior
were the pictures on the wall to most of the pictures on the
walls of that town.  Emily's grandfather, once the Governor
of the sprawling infant state of Illinois, had brought that
engraving of Mt. Vernon sentimentality to the wilderness
because he remembered his mother holding her successive
babies up to see the dogs and horses that surrounded the father
of his country, who stood in a declamatory attitude on the
very brink of the Potomac, with his women folk and youthful
intimates hovering pictorially about him.
</p>

<p>
Emily used to compare that picture, chuckling, to the picture
of Boston which one of her neighbors had made for herself,
upon her return from a memorable visit there.  Mrs. Jennings
was chairman of the art committee and a busy woman, and
hadn't time to "do" many pictures, she said.  So she just put
everything she wanted to remember into one.  And Lexington
and Concord, Bunker Hill and the Common, Longfellow's
house and Faneuil Hall, jostled one another in a staggered and
staggering row all across the foreground.  And there was
Mrs. Johnson's parlor.  Every time Emily went into it she used to
say: "Well, my aunt might have been worse.  She didn't paint
at least, thank God!"  She had left no bilious works of her
brush behind her, and she deserved credit for it, considering
the fashion of her day.  She had left a cherished large framed
photograph of the door of St. Mark's.  Emily could recall
exactly the tone in which she used to say "The portal of
St. Mark's," for she had always added "by the sea," which mystified
the child.  The geography said plainly that all Venice was
by the sea.  Besides Italy and Mt. Vernon, there were what
Emily considered two perfectly lovely large "studies" of
Martha's head.  A cousin who played with photography had
done them when the child was seven years old.  She was the
cousin who had gathered the child into her arms, on one
occasion and cried, "Oh, twinkle, twinkle, little star!"  Martha
hated them, and pleaded for their banishment, but Emily would
not listen to her, not for a minute.  There sat a photo of Jim
on the desk, and one of his mother, and an early one of his
father.  And there was, of course, that first seal of a
D.A.R. invulnerability, a framed sampler.  Altogether, Emily had
always been secure that her living room was not just a common
small-town room.
</p>

<p>
But after Martha's&mdash;well, what was wrong with it, she sat
wondering that morning, a bit ruefully.  Some way it was
tamed and tolerating.  Those high-handed colors upstairs dared
the world, and demanded.  These young things went raging,
commanding, soaring into life.  "Not like me," she thought,
vaguely.  "I just hesitated&mdash;and submitted&mdash;and got along,
some way.  How puny I was, and&mdash;sort of helpless.  That
book&mdash;I shrank from it as if it had been some great thing.  But
Eve snubs it.  She ignores it.  They fly, these children&mdash;they
just fly.  But I rode just a bicycle.  And this room wabbles
along on a bicycle.  I must speed it up.  I must&mdash;get these
things done over&mdash;or else I ought to get some new pictures,
or something.  I better ask Martha, perhaps, to freshen it up
a little."
</p>

<p>
Certainly that stranger had asked Martha's advice.  The
memory of her respectful tone was wine to Emily.  She had
to speak to Bob about it.  She couldn't just let him go on
thinking that Martha "amounted" to nothing.
</p>

<p>
"I could see that they thought it was wonderful for a girl of
her age to have planned it all," she told him.  "That woman
asked Martha definitely to come and see the plans for her
house!"
</p>

<p>
But he said: "The dickens she did!  The kid's got her head
swelled enough now, without anybody asking her advice.  The
dame must be hard up if she's got to come to Martha for
advice!"
</p>

<p>
The girls played golf that afternoon.  Emily's mind, when
it had intervals of leisure, dwelt upon the question of new
furniture&mdash;somewhat reluctantly.  After all, maybe it would
be better to suffer the old faded colors than to flee to others
that you know not of.  Such a lot of trouble, going to the city
to select things, and then, maybe, when you get them home,
they don't fit in, as you had intended them to.  And she even
realized her reluctance.  "That's the point about being young.
Martha would just jump into the shopping fray.  She would
dive right in, without hesitation."  These meditations kept
Emily from giving "that man" even a thought, until almost
supper time.  Then, as she passed into the hall, Marion Wright,
giving her arms a sturdy swing, almost struck her, and drew
back, apologizing.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm so sorry!  I didn't see you!  I was just practicing
that drive.  I didn't want to forget it, such a classy one!
Richard Quin was just teaching us, you know, Mrs. Kenworthy."
</p>

<p>
"Who's Richard Quin?" Emily asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's Eve's brother-in-law.  Marion likes him.  Don't
you, Marion?" Martha asked.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I can't say I'm crazy about him.  But still, he can
play.  I'm not particular who coaches me.  I do prefer them
not so fat."
</p>

<p>
"Fat!" murmured Martha.  "He isn't fat.  He's just a large
man.  He's well built."
</p>

<p>
"Of course they're more fun married," Marion went on,
trying to shock Emily.  And then she asked, suddenly curious,
"Do you like him, Mrs. Kenworthy?"
</p>

<p>
"Do I like him?  Goodness, no!  He's greasy looking."
</p>

<p>
Martha said with dignity: "Mother doesn't know him.  She
never said a word to him in her life.  He's not greasy at all,
if you see him close.  He shaves twice a day."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know he does?" Emily demanded.
</p>

<p>
"He's not reticent, anyway," Marion said laughing.
</p>

<p>
"He just happened to mention it."
</p>

<p>
"Did you see his wife?" Emily asked them both.
</p>

<p>
"Eve told you she wasn't well.  She wasn't there."
</p>

<p>
Martha looked at her mother, perplexed.  Emily looked at
her daughter uneasily.  It was annoying of Martha to defend
that man!  If Emily had known he was to be on the links, she
wouldn't have let Martha go to play.  But now, of course the
wisest would be just to let the matter drop.  Martha was always
so trustworthy.  Certainly her good taste could be trusted.
</p>

<p>
Yet for some reason, when Johnnie Benton came that evening
to take the three adorned girls to the dance, Emily was
more impressed by him than ever.  She felt so safe when
Martha was under his care.  She watched them drive away,
and then went out to potter about as usual in the garden, just
at dark.  A neighbor came bringing her, in a strawberry box,
a few rare seedling pansies, and together they made a little
place protected from the heat in which they might be nursed.
And then they went and sat down inside the screened veranda
to escape the mosquitoes.
</p>

<p>
They were still talking there when Bob came.  But he took
his magazine and sat down a few chairs away, and they talked
on as if no one was within hearing of their voices.  And indeed
no one was, for Bob habitually absented himself in the print
before his eyes.  He was unconscious of everything around
him.  Energetic, insistent demands and clamors could get only
a muttered "Uh-uh!" from him.  He really didn't know when
the neighbor left, although he had sort of muttered at her.
</p>

<p>
So Emily sat still and alone in the darkness, and glad of the
quietness.  She thought over one by one the dozen men&mdash;Martha
called them men, though they scarcely deserved the
name&mdash;who would be dancing with the girls at the club.  Emily
knew every one of them; some of them she had known for
years.  She knew the families of most of them.  Every time
she thought of Martha's partner of the evening before, they
seemed more acceptable to her.  They were&mdash;decent.  They
were&mdash;secure.  They had no foreign accent, and they had not
pretended to know Tchekhoff.  People gossiped about them,
but Emily believed their relationships with bootleggers were
merest flirtations.  Their scrapes were ridiculous&mdash;like
Johnnie's opera&mdash;-but they were not vicious&mdash;often.  Bob called
them "nail-polishers," and "shiny Johnnies," and thought
pessimistically about their chances of success in this competitive
life.  But Emily, musing away, liked them all that night.
</p>

<p>
Bob threw down his magazine, after a while, and returned
to Emily's presence.  He got up and lit a cigar, and went
into the house.  Emily heard him there talking to some one
by 'phone about insurance.  He came out and sat down on the
railing in front of her.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go to bed," he said.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him.  There he sat, a heavy, rather sluggish
man with a growth of black beard which he conspicuously did
not shave twice a day.  His hair was not as thick as it had
been ten years ago, but not less unruly, and his digestion was
decidedly poorer.  He was working hard, and making money,
and usually tired.  He was still more even-tempered than
most men.  From the time Martha went away to school till
she came home for holiday he scarcely spoke an irritable word.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I'd wait till the girls come home."
</p>

<p>
"You're dead tired."
</p>

<p>
"I know it, but they'll be here soon.  It's nearly twelve now."
</p>

<p>
"Let's go out and get them."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Let's."
</p>

<p>
They had done that more than once.  Bob was always ready
for a drive even over that road which they must take along
the river.  Two miles of that sinuous and uncertain byway had
been the cause, like the rest of the country club, of a great wave
of hard feeling in the community.  Were the taxpayers going
to keep it up for a few rich "sporty" families? asked the
indignant, so successfully that now the handful of members had
either to repair it themselves or endure its flooded ruts.  The
country club had not been well managed.  Mrs. Benton had
washed her hands of it in the beginning, prophesying its
downfall.  The founders had not counted the cost.  The less
wealthy couldn't stand the assessments and had dropped out.
Those who remained had to pay more.  And it was all a
muddle and a burden and a quarrel&mdash;a perfect example of how
Mrs. Benton did not manage things.  Emily was one of those
who still kept membership.  She seldom used the place, but
she wanted Martha to have a place to play golf.  The more
Martha danced there, the less she would disturb her father by
dancing at home.  And really, it was a very nice crowd of
young people who gathered there.  By night, as Bob and Emily
drove in, it looked gay and lovely, lit all up, among the trees,
with the dancers gliding about.  By day, of course, its appearance
justified the scorn which neighboring towns poured upon
it.  However, those towns, since last night's event, would be
less boastful.
</p>

<p>
Bob stopped the car and they sat looking in.  Now Martha
had had on a little dress faintly pink at the neck and deeply
carmine at the hem, so that, if she had been there, Emily
would have seen her in a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Where <i>is</i> the kid?" Bob grumbled.  Emily looked about
under the trees, and saw Johnnie Benton leave the couple with
whom he was smoking and come over to them.  Bob repeated
his question immediately.  And Johnnie said, indifferently,
looking in towards the lighted floor:
</p>

<p>
"Isn't she there?  I guess she's out having a petting party
somewhere with that dago necker."
</p>

<p>
Emily was thoroughly annoyed by the boy's impertinence.
The idea of his daring to say a thing to her of Martha.
</p>

<p>
"Who d'you mean?" Bob demanded.
</p>

<p>
"You know, that bearded guy she's falling for."
</p>

<p>
"Eve's brother-in-law?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Is she with that&mdash;&mdash;"  Emily nudged Bob violently.
</p>

<p>
"She generally is!"  So Johnnie wasn't so indifferent, after
all, to the fact as he had wanted them to believe.  And then the
music stopped, and the girls came nocking out to the drive like
butterflies.  Marion Wright called upon Johnnie to witness
that there was just one more dance, and then they would all
go home, and Martha, she said, had already gone, walking
home.
</p>

<p>
Emily asked in reply, unconcernedly, if they were having a
good time, and told them not to hurry, and said, "No, they
wouldn't wait for an ice&mdash;the night was so hot they had thought
they would drive out to cool off."  But here the ice was&mdash;and she
ate it hurriedly, fearing what Bob might say about Martha
before them, nudging him mentally, as it were, into silence.
</p>

<p>
No sooner was the car turned towards home than Bob
broke out:
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll be damned!  I won't have this, Emily."
</p>

<p>
"Funny we didn't see them, if they're walking home."
</p>

<p>
"I thought she had <i>some</i> sense.  What's he doing out
here?  Did you know he was coming?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I never thought of it.  Of course the family belongs."
</p>

<p>
"The nerve of him!  Does anyone else come uninvited?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Bob, we must be careful!  Did you hear what Johnnie
said?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll settle that girl to-night.  She isn't going to be running
around at midnight with any married man."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Bob, we mustn't be hasty.  You must think this over.
We don't want to&mdash;seem to take this&mdash;too seriously.  He'll be
leaving, likely, in a day or two."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know he will?"
</p>

<p>
"I <i>suppose</i> he will.  Didn't Eve say so?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't hear her.  And it's the principle of the thing.  She
thinks it's smart to be flirting with a married man."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't think she does, Bob.  He's so different&mdash;from
these boys here."  And then suddenly she begged: "Look,
Bob!  Oh, let me do the talking to her!"  For walking slowly
along, side by side, were the two of them, little rosy Martha
and the man that seemed always bending over her.  So near
they were that Bob stopped the car with a jerk.
</p>

<p>
"We'll give you a lift," he said, unceremoniously.  "Get in!"
</p>

<p>
Martha introduced her companion.  Bob gave the shortest
possible sign of being aware of his existence.  He was opening
the car door.
</p>

<p>
"Get in!" he said to his daughter.
</p>

<p>
"It's a glorious night for walking," Mr. Quin remarked,
standing still.
</p>

<p>
"It's too late.  Get in!"  Bob again spoke directly to Martha.
</p>

<p>
She turned to her escort.  "It is rather muddy here.  Let's
ride a little."  And she got serenely in, and bade him follow her.
The car started.
</p>

<p>
Emily turned around in her seat.
</p>

<p>
"You staying long in town, Mr. Quin?  I meant to call.  But
Eve said your wife isn't well."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I'm not sure yet.  It's all so interesting to me.  A
Western town like this.  It's quite surprised me."  Hadn't Eve
said the man was brought up in Indiana?  His tone annoyed
Emily so that she turned abruptly about in her seat.  Martha
leaned forward to her.
</p>

<p>
"He thinks it's the most ripping dance hall he ever saw, of
the kind, mother."  Ripping, was it?  Such a distinguished
word, so unlike this West, Emily was saying to herself.  Where
was Bob going?  Why didn't he take them directly home?  He
had turned, and in a minute, before they knew it almost, they
had stopped in front of Eve's home.
</p>

<p>
"We'll drop you here," said Bob.
</p>

<p>
The stranger looked at Martha.
</p>

<p>
She said, surprised: "No&mdash;&mdash;  Oh&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's the way we have in these Western towns," Bob remarked,
shortly.  The man said good night reluctantly and as
meaningly as possible, with Emily's eye upon him.
</p>

<p>
In the light of the living room, Emily said: "Look at your
slippers, Martha!  What made you walk home in them?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mother, it was such moonlight.  You were absolutely
rude to him, mother.  I never saw you act so before," Martha
spoke grievedly.
</p>

<p>
"I know a snubbing when I get one.  He didn't ask me to
call on his wife."
</p>

<p>
"But, mother, you know she isn't well.  Eve said so."
</p>

<p>
"If she isn't well I think he'd better devote himself
exclusively to her.  Martha, I don't like this.  He ought to know
better, if you don't.  You'll get yourself talked about, if this
keeps on."
</p>

<p>
Martha opened her eyes in unfeigned surprise.
</p>

<p>
"That's a funny way for you to talk, mother.  You always
say people have no right to go gossiping around about girls!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I certainly said girls oughtn't to do silly things to
start people talking."
</p>

<p>
"I get sick of this town!  It's only in a little crude hole of a
place like this a girl can't look at a man after he's married.
He knows more in a minute than all the boys in this place know
in a year.  And just because he's got a wife I'm not to listen to
him, I suppose!"
</p>

<p>
"You are certainly not to&mdash;to let him spend all his time
with you.  You went with Johnnie.  Why didn't you come
home with him?  Did you know that he&mdash;this Quin person&mdash;was
to be there, Martha?"
</p>

<p>
Martha stood there looking straight at her mother, as if she
had seen in her something new and perplexing.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, mother?  What's all the fuss about,
anyway?"
</p>

<p>
"About this man.  He's married.  He oughtn't to be following
you about when his wife's at home sick.  I'm disgusted
with you, Martha."
</p>

<p>
"Because he happens to be married?"
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't <i>happen</i> to be married; he <i>is</i> married."
</p>

<p>
"I don't follow you, mother."
</p>

<p>
Martha spoke, with her head held high, in the lazy tone
she used to infuriate her father.
</p>

<p>
Emily said, gently smiling: "There's no use your trying
that on me, Martha.  You follow me exactly.  You know
exactly what I mean, and you're to remember what I say."
</p>

<p>
"You never spoke like this to me before, mother."  She
would try being hurt.
</p>

<p>
"I never had occasion to, thank goodness!  And I'm not
going to speak to you this way again, either."  They both
heard Bob coming in.  "Now go to bed," Emily said, kissing
her, "and be a good girl."  Martha kissed her in return,
without any sign of annoyance, and ran quickly upstairs.
</p>

<p>
"Where is she?" Bob demanded.
</p>

<p>
"She's gone to bed."
</p>

<p>
"Just like her.  She crawls out of everything.  Did you
settle her once for all?"
</p>

<p>
"I spoke to her about it.  I told her we didn't like it."
</p>

<p>
"You're too easy with her, Emily.  I'm going to settle her
in the morning.  I'm going to lay down the law to her!"
</p>

<p>
He was going to lay down the law to her, was he, when he
had never in his life laid down his work for an hour for her
sake!  Emily, that placid woman, for the third time in one
evening, was ruffled and resentful.  Johnnie had disturbed her.
"That man" had annoyed her.  And now, all of a sudden, Bob,
who had never done anything but stand aside and watch her
manage Martha, was going to take her in hand.  He had
literally had no time for the girl since she was born; and now he
seemed to think she ought to listen to him.
</p>

<p>
She said nothing, being wise, and he went up to bed.  The
Wright girls came in, presently, with Johnnie and Chris
Phillips, all of them together making a little eddying whirlpool
of youth in the quiet room.  Emily, moved by some instinct
of security for Martha, called up to her to come down.  "Oh,"
they said, "is Martha home?"  Emily replied carelessly that
they had picked her up near the bridge, and instantly she
happened to look at Helen Wright.  She had not been thinking of
the effect of her remark, but she saw Helen wink&mdash;yes,
undoubtedly just wink&mdash;at Johnnie, and she saw he didn't want
to be winked at on the subject.  She felt a sharp mistrust of
that girl&mdash;her expressive, cynical face.  What did she mean?
Did she know with whom Martha had chosen to walk home?
She thanked goodness that Helen Wright wasn't staying long.
She didn't like her.
</p>

<p>
Martha had only tarried a minute&mdash;long enough to have
paid, perhaps, her tribute to the mirror, but by the time she
came down the boys had left.  Johnnie said it would be a
change to go once before he got sent home.  Martha didn't
deign to notice his absence.  She talked serenely to her guests.
</p>

<p>
But Emily, in her bed, remembered, sighing more than once,
how that horrid Helen had sat looking at Martha, with cynical,
initiated amusement.  Perhaps that girl was encouraging her
in her naughtiness.  If Martha wasn't careful&mdash;and she probably
wouldn't be&mdash;she would be getting into a horrible row with
her father.  That consummation Emily Kenworthy would do
anything to avoid.  If Bob "bawled her out" in the morning,
the world underneath their feet would be splitting.  Martha
and that odious stranger would be on one side, and Bob would
be on the other.  And Emily&mdash;well, there was never a moment's
doubt in her mind where she would be!
</p>

<p>
She remembered, indignant at the thought of it, that
perfectly absurd situation of her friend, Mrs. Harding, whose
daughter had married, to the utter rage and final alienation of
her father.  One day, months after that, Mrs. Harding had
come creeping into the Kenworthys' house, almost a stranger
then, and had begged for the loan of two hundred dollars, just
begged for it, ashamed and whispering, because her daughter
was ill, and without a penny, in a rooming house demanding its
rent.  A girl friend of hers had seen her there, and had come
back to urge her mother to help her.  In all her life Emily
had never had to consider the state of a woman living
comfortably without one cent of her own to put a finger on.  "If
I were you," she had exclaimed to Mrs. Harding, "I would go
straight to her.  I would bring her home, or take her some
place and take care of her."  But Mrs. Harding dared not defy
her husband.  He was an old man, and delicate, and it might
kill him.  And Emily had been on the point of saying: "I
don't believe it!  And if it does, he deserves it!"  She had
entered heartily into that conspiracy, and it had all turned out
so well, and the two women had become friends.  Yet Emily
essentially disapproved of her "kowtowing" to her husband.
There would be nothing like that in her house!  If any great,
deep chasm was to come splitting across the ground on which
the Kenworthy family stood, Emily was going to be on the
side of her daughter!  Was it likely that she would give up
that Jim Kenworthy&mdash;that she would have allowed her dear
lover to go away to die alone&mdash;for that child's sake, and now
give up the child merely for Bob Kenworthy?
</p>

<p>
"Bob," she said, emphatically.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" He was sleepy.
</p>

<p>
"You aren't to 'settle' Martha in the morning!  You are to
leave her to me!"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"I say you aren't to scold Martha in the morning about&mdash;that
man.  I've talked to her about it, and that's enough."
</p>

<p>
"She won't mind you, Emily."
</p>

<p>
"She'll mind me at least as much as she would you.  And
more, too.  And I'm not going to have you two&mdash;quarreling
and arguing about&mdash;this&mdash;person.  Do you understand that,
Bob?  If you&mdash;speak to her about it, she'll get to thinking
that she's on one side with that man, and you and I are on the
other side."
</p>

<p>
"She's on his side now."
</p>

<p>
"No, Bob, she isn't.  She is just&mdash;playing; she wants a little
rope."
</p>

<p>
"She's got enough to hang herself now."
</p>

<p>
"You won't speak to her, will you, Bob, now?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well," Bob grumbled, "she's your kid, Emily.  You've
got to manage her.  She won't listen to anything I say,
anyway."
</p>

<p>
"But I mean, don't you just begin to&mdash;don't you forget and
bring the subject up, at all, will you, Bob?"
</p>

<p>
"I won't say a word to her if you make her quit it.  If you
don't, I'll take her in hand.  I won't stand for her getting talked
about all over town!"
</p>

<p>
"She's not going to get talked about, Bob!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well.  Manage her to suit yourself."
</p>

<p>
That was the most he could say.  He could offer her no help.
All she could ask of him was that he would refrain from
interfering.  But if Jim had been in Bob's place, Jim would have
known what to do.  Martha would have listened if Jim could
have spoken to her.  And Jim would have listened if Emily
had gone to him in perplexity about the girl.  Hadn't she and
Jim sat together for hours discussing their children, enjoying
them together, having them in common, almost, in spite of
the barrier between them?  Because Jim had always appreciated
little Martha Kenworthy.  That was the essential wrong Bob
had done the child since birth.  He had failed to appreciate
her.  He had never in his life understood a woman.  He had
never even given the proper value to his own mother.  And
Jim's adulterous wife he had simply cursed whenever he thought
of her.  It was only men that Bob could evaluate.  There was no
use expecting him to judge Martha fairly.  But Jim had
enjoyed every phase of her little girlhood, just as he had
played tenderly, reverently with his mother's heroisms and
weaknesses, just as he had so well understood every shade of
the service Emily had unconsciously rendered him when she
had loved his son.  If Martha had a man like Jim about
familiarly, she wouldn't be impressed as she seemed to be with
the first pretentious masher that came her way.  Jim would
have set a standard for the child, given her a taste for masculine
worth.  And it all went back again to the old, old question:
Why didn't I marry Jim in the first place?  Why did I ever
quarrel with him?  Why was I brought up so that I could
quarrel with him, about a book, merely a book that is this
minute lying neglected on the shelf in the painted room because
the girls were bored with old classics?  I married Bob to get
away from this house, said Emily.  But Martha will never
marry to get away from that, Emily vowed again.

<h3>
<i>Chapter Four</i>
</h3>

<p>
Afterwards, when Emily, thinking those summer weeks
over, used to ask herself again and again why she hadn't
prevented their climax, she could scarcely recall how her
realization of the situation had come about.  She had told Martha that
she didn't want Eve's brother-in-law singling her out for his
attention.  She had supposed that was sufficient.  She had
gone with Martha to take the Wrights home the next day, and
all very merrily the afternoon had gone, just as afternoons
usually went before that man came rumbling on the horizon.
There had been no mention of him till towards supper time.
Martha's chum, Greta, had come in then, asking her to go for
a swim.  Emily liked Greta, with reservations and allowances,
thinking her too pretty to be judged severely.  She had dazzling
eyes: light-blue eyes when she wore light blue; dark-blue eyes
when she wore dark blue; gray eyes when she had on a gray
suit; and when she pulled that wicked little mauve hat down
over her forehead, her eyes were purple as dark pansies.  One
had to forgive that girl for somewhat too deliberately flashing
those glances into male consciousness, Emily argued.  But
Greta didn't&mdash;quite tell the very truth&mdash;always.  Just lately
in a crisis she had told one tale, and Martha had told another
of what happened, and it had all had to come out, Martha
justified, a truthful child, and Greta&mdash;well, perhaps she had
learned her lesson.  Emily believed so.
</p>

<p>
Now that afternoon when she came in on her way to the
beach, Martha was indiscreet, to say the least.  She said
demurely enough, when Greta urged her:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know whether I'm allowed to go swimming.
Am I, mammie?"
</p>

<p>
Emily had asked innocently, "Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's sure to be some married men about, some
place."  And Greta had smiled, as if she understood Martha's
cause for complaint.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be silly!" Emily had replied.  They had gone swimming.
Afterwards Emily wondered if Martha had known that
man would be there, if she had taken that way of warding off
subsequent reproof.  She wondered, but she could reach no
conclusion.  She could never make out clearly how it had
gone on.  She hadn't even known for certain that Martha was
seeing the man.  She had thought it better to trust her.
</p>

<p>
Eve had returned the next day, and Emily had been glad,
feeling that Eve would be a protection.  The girls had gone
together to spend the week-end at Geneva with friends.  That had
been planned days ago.  Bob had remarked uneasily, looking
up from the daily at noon on Monday:
</p>

<p>
"That bird's in Geneva, Emily!"
</p>

<p>
"Who?"
</p>

<p>
"Quin, that brother-in-law of Eve's."
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't he be?" Emily had asked, carelessly.  And
she asked herself the same question, but not so carelessly.
What was more natural than that he should have gone fishing?
Didn't everybody go fishing?  Wasn't there a long list in the
paper every Monday of all the men from the town who had
gone, even though they went regularly every Saturday of the
season?  The editor had to have something to fill up his
columns, and that list, and the list of those who went to Chicago
daily to shop, could always be depended upon.  Still&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Afterwards she sometimes thought that she should have said
to Martha: "Did you see Mr. Quin at Geneva?  Did you know
he was going to be there?" She might have asked that question
the following Wednesday.  Perhaps that was where she had
made her great mistake.  She should have asked Martha
directly what had happened there.
</p>

<p>
For Eve came home that day from the links alone, and
announced she was going to Chicago at once to her father; that
she had thought when she came to live in this town that at
least she wouldn't have her sister hanging around, and her
brother-in-law.  She wasn't going to come back till they cleared
out, she said, angrily red.  Afterwards Emily knew that she
ought to have asked her exactly what the quarrel had been about.
She had, however, practically asked Martha later.  Martha had
said indifferently she supposed Eve was tired of the little town.
It wasn't good enough for her, perhaps.  She had spoken
sarcastically.  She didn't regret Eve's departure.  She had gone
on her way undisturbed.  Perhaps she had spent more time
with her friends than she usually did.  At home she was quiet;
but she had always been that.  She had always sat excited, as
it were, by her thoughts, chuckling to herself about what was
in her mind.  Her Uncle Jim had said of her child that it was
<i>herself</i> she seemed always to be enjoying.  She had seemed
to have a hidden source of delight to muse on.  Johnnie was
no longer about the house.  When Emily commented on this
fact, Martha had explained indifferently that he had an awful
case on a De Kalb girl.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon Emily sat talking to an old, trustworthy
friend.  "When's Eve coming back?  You know her sister?"
Grace Phillips had asked.
</p>

<p>
Emily couldn't believe she had asked it in malice.  She
thought afterwards it might have been a well-meant warning.
Emily had said she had not even seen the sister.  She wasn't
receiving callers.
</p>

<p>
"You see more of him, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
Emily had repressed her surprise, and answered, vaguely,
"No; that is, not a great deal.  Eve&mdash;not when Eve isn't here."
</p>

<p>
What did Mrs. Phillips mean?  Had she seen Martha with
that man?
</p>

<p>
"I hear the old grandmother gets worse all the time,"
Mrs. Phillips had innocently continued.  Emily had said she didn't
know.
</p>

<p>
It was after four then; soon after that there had come a
long-distance 'phone call: four friends in the next county
were driving up to dance in Chicago.  Would Martha go with
them?  They'd be along soon after seven.  As Emily hung up
the receiver she saw a sort of chance.  She would go out to the
golf course and bring Martha home to get ready for the evening,
and take occasion to see exactly who was playing there,
and then she would be rid of this uneasiness.  She hated taking
the car herself, but it was time she made sure of what was
going on.
</p>

<p>
So she drove out, inch by inch around by the dusty detour,
over the well-known ruts.  She turned the car anxiously
through the gates, which always looked so narrow when she
was driving that to miss their post seemed almost miraculous.
She chose her place of stopping very carefully, a large place
easy to turn around in, in case Martha wasn't there and she had
to go back by herself.
</p>

<p>
She shut off the engine, congratulating herself the more
upon the neatness of her achievement because some other
woman had stopped her car&mdash;but not her engine&mdash;wrong way
about, at some distance, so that she sat almost facing Emily.  A
stranger she was.  With a swanky little scarlet hat on, and
rouged; waiting for some one, looking intently towards the
path through the trees by which the players came up to the
shack of a clubhouse.
</p>

<p>
And then it occurred to Emily that that woman must be
Eve's sister, because that must be the car that Eve drove.
She looked, naturally, with renewed interest.  The face was
in some ways like Eve's.  But it was no wonder Eve didn't like
her.  She was a discontented woman, ill-natured, with hollows
about her eyes, like Eve, but more accentuated; altogether
hard faced.  She was probably waiting for her husband.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I go and speak to her, or shall I not?" Emily
wondered.  The woman hadn't once looked in her direction.
Either she was intent upon the path and had not heard anyone
coming, or purposely avoided chances of being intruded upon.
</p>

<p>
Emily had not been sitting there undecided one minute when
the woman leaned suddenly forward, shifting her position to
get a better view of something.  Emily's eyes turned, naturally,
to see what she was so eagerly looking at.  There were four
people walking towards them at a little distance, two in front,
young Mr. and Mrs. Williams, two behind, little Martha
Kenworthy and that man.  Martha had on a pleated white skirt and
a belted overblouse of pale yellow crêpe de Chine, with a square
neck, and she was walking along, slight and young, bareheaded,
of course, with her face all flushed pink, looking up, all smiling
and interested, to that man, who seemed, as always, to be leaning
down over her.  They came walking towards her.  They
were talking about something so amusing, so intimately
interesting, that they paid no attention to the two cars.  Emily
sitting there, sickening, saw Mrs. Williams call Martha's
attention to her mother.  She saw the absorbed two turn from their
topic and look towards her.
</p>

<p>
She had looked again quickly at the woman.  She knew what
she had been waiting for.  She saw the discontented face flush
angrily, as Eve's did sometimes; and then, just as that man
drew near, when he had seen his wife sitting there, she started
her car and drove hastily away.
</p>

<p>
Martha was coming up to her mother.  Mrs. Williams was
with her.  The men had stopped to talk together about
something, a few steps away.  Had the Williamses seen that
woman?  Would they know who she was?
</p>

<p>
"Hello, mother!" Martha said, quite naturally.  And Emily,
she hoped undismayed, explained to her and Mrs. Williams why
she had come.  "I thought I'd better come and get you, so you'd
have time enough to get ready," she said.
</p>

<p>
Martha jumped in, taking her place at the wheel.  She had
come out with Greta, whom Emily saw at some distance, coming
towards her.  She asked Mrs. Williams to tell her she had
gone home.  They whirled away.
</p>

<p>
"Martha!" Emily said, sternly, "I came out here to get you.
And this is what I find.  Do you know who was in that car?"
</p>

<p>
"What car?"
</p>

<p>
"That one ahead, that just drove out."  Martha looked down
the road.
</p>

<p>
"Eve?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Her sister.  She came out here to see if her husband was
with you," Emily's voice trembled with dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Why, mother!" Martha was indignant.  "What makes you
say such a thing?"
</p>

<p>
"I saw her expression.  She was waiting to catch him with
you.  Do the Williamses know her?  Oh, I wonder if they saw
that&mdash;if they understood?  Mr. Jenkinson was sitting on the
porch there.  Martha, this is the end of that.  I didn't like
you being with that man before; but, now I've seen her, I
simply won't have it.  She's jealous.  Why, Martha, a girl
might get into an awful mess, this way!  That woman&mdash;driving
away in that way.  Quarreling in public&mdash;that way!"
</p>

<p>
"She quarrels with everybody, Eve says," Martha commented,
indifferently.
</p>

<p>
"Well, she's not going to have any excuse for quarreling
with us.  You hear what I say, Martha?  You're not to play
golf, or swim or ride or walk or dance or even smile at that
man in public, any place, where anybody can see you."
</p>

<p>
"It'll look sort of funny, mother, when he's everywhere I am."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care how it looks.  It'll look a lot better than having
his wife watching him flirting with you."
</p>

<p>
Martha raised her head proudly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know why you should say a thing like that to me!
I was NOT flirting, I was just talking to him, mammie!  This
seems so&mdash;unworthy of you."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then.  You aren't to talk to him any more.
You've got to obey me!  You've got to do exactly what I say
in this, Martha!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know why you get so worked up over this!  You
never talk so about anybody else!"
</p>

<p>
"You never look that way at any other man!"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I never find anyone so interesting!"
</p>

<p>
"It's disgusting.  You ought to be spanked!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not a child!"
</p>

<p>
"You certainly are!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm twenty in April."
</p>

<p>
"Can she know how that threat&mdash;yes, sheer threat of
independence&mdash;hurts me?" Emily wondered.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Martha, you mustn't be&mdash;you <i>mustn't</i>!  It isn't fair.
That woman is unhappy!  She's haggard!  She's sick, and she
sees him playing about with you!"
</p>

<p>
"Am I so dangerous?  Can't she even let him talk to a child?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to argue with you.  I've simply laid down
the law, for once.  You're not to be seen even talking with
that man again.  Do you understand that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you understand it before?"
</p>

<p>
"I never thought you'd act this way about it."
</p>

<p>
"I never thought for a minute you'd go on, after what I said
to you."
</p>

<p>
"Do you want me to tell him I'm not allowed to speak to him?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't care what you tell him.  You're able to make a
man understand when he's not welcome, I hope, at your age."
</p>

<p>
"A mere child like me, mammie?" Martha asked.  But Emily
didn't deign to notice her sarcasm.  They rode the rest of the
way in silence.  Martha went directly to her room.  She came
down for supper, and ate in silence.  When it was over she
began clearing away the dishes.  Was she going to be a martyr?
She passed through the living room, when she had finished
them, on the way to her room.
</p>

<p>
"If they call for me, you can tell them I'm not going," she
told Emily.
</p>

<p>
But the girls, when they came, wouldn't take any such answer.
They ran into the house and up to the painted room.  They
must have persuaded her, for she came down with them, all
dressed and ready, and, after they had told Emily they were
going to keep her till the next afternoon, she said good-by coolly
and departed with them.
</p>

<p>
And Emily was glad.  Anything to get the child's mind away
from the afternoon, from "that man."  She wished Martha
would stay with those nice young girls and go playing about
with the lads they played with for a week.  Perhaps that
man would have left town by that time.  Perhaps Eve would
come back.  And there was Mary Carr, who was to come for
a visit some time during the holiday, and other girls.  If
Martha would only invite them for next week!  Emily, sitting
on the dark veranda, clung eagerly to these hopes.  Remembering
the expression of that woman's face, she planned almost
frantically.  She would take Martha and go&mdash;to Estey's
Park&mdash;or&mdash;to Banff; she would go to Alaska or&mdash;Italy&mdash;Norway&mdash;any
place.  Home had become&mdash;not a refuge, not a playground
of happy security, but a dangerous, threatening place.  She
wished devoutly that Eve and her family had never come to the
town.
</p>

<p>
However, when Emily suggested Colorado, Martha said it
was too hot to travel.  Trains would be horrible such nights.
And that was true.  "This house," Martha remarked, truly,
"is cooler than any place else is."  When Emily asked about
the visit Martha had been looking forward to, she replied:
"Dorothy's father has broken his leg.  I don't think they want
me now."  When Emily asked, after a discreet interval, when
Mary Carr was to be expected, Martha said: "I don't know
yet&mdash;exactly.  It's such a lot of work for you now, company,
in the heat.  It's sort of nice to have a rest, for a change."  This
was something new.  And there was something new about
the atmosphere of the house.  Martha had stopped baiting her
father.  She had stopped chattering with her mother.  She
sat through the meals a well-behaved and silent child.  She
offered to help about the house more thoughtfully than she
sometimes had.  And when she had finished her tasks, she
withdrew to the painted room.
</p>

<p>
She had said she wanted a sitting room, and she had got
one.  But Emily had never foreseen that she meant to withdraw
from the family altogether.  When her friends came now,
they went upstairs to her.  Emily felt strangely alone, deprived
of their chatter.  When she went up to them, the girls received
her as usual.  Their tongues wagged on still.  They seemed
not to notice Martha's withdrawal, but Emily did.  She told
herself that she had been trying always to get Martha to
rest.  And now when Martha was going to bed early, when she
was lying on her bed reading, or pretending to, sleeping, or
pretending to, all the afternoons, Emily was uncomfortable.
Even Bob said: "What's got into the kid?  Where's the
gang?"
</p>

<p>
Emily wouldn't ask Bob about "that man."  She saw him
one day on the street.  The next day Martha announced she
was going to Chicago.  She had to get something for cushions,
and a tray.  Emily offered to go with her.  Martha expressed
no eagerness for her company, but showed a desire to go
alone.  She went, and came back with her purchases.
</p>

<p>
She went again the next week.  Emily was glad to have her
away, for a change.  She had never gone to play golf since that
afternoon.  She went about with her girl friends when she
couldn't avoid going.  She went nearly every evening for a
swim with some of them.  When she came back, sometimes
she went and sat alone in the boat tied under the willow until
bedtime.  Emily's heart smote her when she saw the girl sitting
alone there, in the starlight, a dimmed firefly among the
shining ones.  That boat, that willow&mdash;were for two.  She had
to think soberly about the deserted veranda, where Bob sat
now without blushing.  And where were the boys that had
been "hanging about" before?  Martha had said more than
once that they came just to "jolly" her mother.  They weren't
coming now for that purpose.  Johnnie passed back and forth
every day up and down the street, but he never came in, unless
his mother had sent him on an errand.
</p>

<p>
The first week of August Emily met Eve downtown.  That
was a jolt.  "Have you been back long?" she asked, carelessly.
And Eve hurried to say that she had been back a few
days, but she was trying to help at home.  Her grandmother
was very bad.  The nurses were busy every minute.  But Eve
was going to find time to come down.  "I meant to come and
see YOU," she asserted, with eager sincerity, with just a little
stress on the "you."  "I'm going to be here all the time now.
My sister's gone," she added cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
When she went on her way, Emily sighed with deep relief.
Those people and their shadow over the Kenworthys had left,
finally.  Maybe things would be gay now, as they used to be.
But Martha, who had given no sign and never mentioned either
of them again to Emily, seemed to be unaware of their
departure.  She was tired, and it was hot, and she wanted to rest.
She stated her case with dignity, gently.  There was nothing
Emily could object to in her bearing.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing they could object to in her manner the
next week, when she refused to drive to Springfield with her
father and mother.  Bob would do the driving, and she had
never liked riding alone in the back seat.  So the Kenworthys
went alone, and spent the day, and came driving back towards
home through the country darkness about midnight.
</p>

<p>
The day had added to the burden on Emily's mind, instead
of lightening it.  She had been visiting a friend while Bob
had been hurrying through his business.  They had been
silent for miles, when Emily began talking, wearily:
</p>

<p>
"Fanny was telling me about her niece, Bob.  She wondered
if we could get her a job in town here.  Her husband has left
her with those two children.  She learned typing, but she
hasn't had any experience.  She wants to get some place where
she can make a home for them.  She'll have to divorce him.  I
wondered&mdash;if she could get some work here, maybe I could
help her with the children, sometimes.  I said we'd look round
and see if we could do anything," Emily sighed.
</p>

<p>
"She married that Grey, didn't she?  Who vamped him?"  That
was the way Bob WOULD put it, of course.  Everything he
thought of as some woman's fault.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  He's no good.  They tried every way to get
her not to marry him."  Emily sighed again.  These daughters&mdash;these
tragedies.  The rumbling of incredible possibilities on
the horizon&mdash;Emily fell silent, sighing sometimes.
</p>

<p>
The car drew up to the house, and Emily reproved herself
for worrying.  It was lighted up; the victrola was playing.  It
would be gay with dancing within.  But the blinds were down,
strange to say.  Never mind that&mdash;Martha was happy again.
She was having a party of friends.  Bob and Emily went up
the walk and into the front hall, both of them relieved and
eager, and through it into the living room, to put down their
parcels on the table.
</p>

<p>
And there Emily stopped by the table, without unloading
her hands.  Bob stopped behind her.  They just stood looking
for a critical second&mdash;looking at Martha and "that man," who
were stopping their dance, drawing away from each other,
returning their gaze.
</p>

<p>
"You're late," said Martha, quite naturally, unperturbed.
</p>

<p>
The man spoke to them.  Emily murmured something.  She
didn't know what to say.  Martha went to the victrola and
stood there, turning it off.  Bob said nothing.  Richard Quin
looked at Martha inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"It's late," he said.  "Really, I'd better be going."
</p>

<p>
Bob took a step towards the table and divested himself of
three large bottles of choice olives and a long sprayer for roses.
He strode towards the man.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you'd better be going," he said.  "If you're wise, you'll
be staying away."  He stood glaring at him, threateningly.
</p>

<p>
Emily came and stood close to Bob.  And Martha came
towards "that man," with her head held high.  She spoke to
him with the most gentle sweetness, looking straight at her
father.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't have a hat, did you?" she asked him.  "It was
so nice of you to think of coming in."  She was going with him
towards the door.  She went with him into the hall.  "Good
night," they heard her say.  "Good night."  She stood in the
hall after the door had shut behind the man.  She waited there.
Emily called her.  And when she came into the light from the
darkness of the hall, it was plain that for once in his life Bob
Kenworthy had "got a rise" out of Martha.  She came straight
at him.  She was white with anger.
</p>

<p>
"How dare you do such a thing!  How dare you speak to
my friends that way!"  Emily had never seen her so furious.
</p>

<p>
"Martha!" she cried, warningly.
</p>

<p>
"I won't stand this!  I'll never ask another friend to this
house as long as I live!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk that way to <i>me</i>!" Bob exclaimed.  "Don't say
<i>dare</i> to me!"
</p>

<p>
And Emily said, soothingly, "Martha, didn't I tell you not
to let that man come here?"
</p>

<p>
"You did <i>not</i>!  You told me not to appear in public with him.
Is this public?  We've been up in my room till just now.  I
pulled the blinds down as soon as we came down!"
</p>

<p>
"My God!" cried Bob.  "You pulled the blinds down!  You
haven't any sense at all.  Have those blinds been down before
all summer?  You're a perfect fool!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to be cursed, mother."  She started towards
the stairs proudly.
</p>

<p>
"You took him up to your bedroom?" Bob exploded.
</p>

<p>
"It's <i>not</i> her bedroom, Bob," Emily was saying.
</p>

<p>
He cried, "Come here and listen to me!"
</p>

<p>
"I won't," replied Martha.  "You can't talk to me in that
condition.  I'm going to bed."
</p>

<p>
Emily saw Bob start towards Martha.  She thought he
was intending seizing her by the arm, pulling her into the
room, making her listen.  So she sank down into a chair.
</p>

<p>
"Bob!" she cried, "come here!" and she began crying.
</p>

<p>
He let Martha go up the stairs.  He came and stood raging
near Emily.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you worry!  I'll put an end to this.  I'll settle her yet.
Don't cry.  I'll put some sense into that girl's head.  She's not
going to take married men up to her bedroom in this house!"
</p>

<p>
"Bob, stop it!  That's not her bedroom!  You just make
things worse!"
</p>

<p>
"I make things worse, do I?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you do!  It's bad enough to have this thing going on!
But you go and quarrel with her.  You never can stop it this
way!  The sillier she is, the wiser we have to be.  Oh, we must
be careful!  I won't have you saying such things to each other!"
</p>

<p>
"What are you blaming <i>me</i> for?  You said you'd tell her to
quit this, and that's all the good it's done us.  Everybody'll
be wondering why the blinds were down when we're away."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wish you hadn't done that!  I wish&mdash;you looked as if
you were intending to knock him down, Bob!"
</p>

<p>
"I <i>did</i> intend to!  He's lucky!  If he comes hanging around
here, I will beat him up.  What business has he got in this
house at midnight?"
</p>

<p>
Emily was rising.  She wiped her eyes.  "I'll go up and
talk to her," she said.
</p>

<p>
When she came into the painted room, Martha, who was
sitting on a day bed, looked at her in surprise, and said, shortly:
"What are you crying about?  Did he do anything to you?"  She
spoke as if her father might have struck her mother.
</p>

<p>
"I was crying because you're so&mdash;because you speak that
way to your father.  I can't stand it, Martha!"
</p>

<p>
"You ought to have got me a civilized father, then&mdash;a human
being.  I get so mad at him!"
</p>

<p>
"You've got to stop it!  I'm not going to live in a house
with you two quarreling all the time."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'll clear out!  I'm not anxious to stay.  You wait till
I'm twenty!"
</p>

<p>
"Martha, you needn't act this way.  You needn't try to make
out you're the offended one.  Did you know he was coming here
to-night?"
</p>

<p>
Martha looked at her mother defiantly.  She hesitated.  She
was a truthful child, at least.  She said, shortly, after a second,
"Yes, I did."
</p>

<p>
"Did you ask him?  Did you arrange to have him come when
we were away?"
</p>

<p>
"You never asked me questions like this about other people."
</p>

<p>
"I want to know, Martha."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I did.  I asked him."
</p>

<p>
"You know I didn't want you to do that."
</p>

<p>
"You told me not to appear in public with him, mother.  I
didn't appear in public.  I minded you.  I don't see anything
to be ashamed of.  I don't see why we should keep it secret.
He wanted to see me, and I wanted to talk to him.  I knew you
wouldn't understand it.  You just insist on misjudging him.
You won't try to get acquainted with him.  I knew dad would
make a fool of himself if he saw him here."
</p>

<p>
"What did he need to see you about?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I&mdash;I don't know why&mdash;I don't know what right&mdash;&mdash;  If
I'd been ashamed of myself, I could have sent him home
before you came, and you'd never even have known he'd been
here."
</p>

<p>
Emily went over and sat down by Martha.  She put her arm
around her.  She tried to pull her close against her, but
Martha was for sitting erect, stiffly.  Her attitude made Emily's
coaxing tone futile.
</p>

<p>
"Martha, he didn't have any business here.  He knew he
wasn't welcome here.  Unless he's absolutely stupid, he understood
that before daddy said a word to him.  If he was a decent
man he would never have come or he would have gone earlier."
</p>

<p>
Martha bristled.  "He did have business here.  He had to see
me."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
The girl rose.  She walked about the room excitedly.  She
began once, and stopped.  She came and stood in front of
Emily.
</p>

<p>
"Now look here, mother.  I don't think you ought to ask
me questions like that.  As though you don't believe me.  But
if you'll stop all this fuss, I'll tell you the whole thing next
week."
</p>

<p>
"What whole thing?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you why he came to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you tell me now, Martha?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I'm not going to tell you now.  I'll tell you next
week.  I'll tell you on Monday or Tuesday.  It isn't anything
to be ashamed of, mother."  Martha spoke with dignity,
reprovingly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose it is."
</p>

<p>
"Then what makes you look at me like a thief?  Why do
you let dad swear at me and curse me?"
</p>

<p>
"That's just silly of you!  He wasn't cursing you, and you
know it.  That's just his way."
</p>

<p>
"I'm tired of his way.  I won't have him using my friends
like that."
</p>

<p>
"He never spoke like that to any other friend, Martha.  He's
patient with them all.  He never&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't want him sitting round to be PATIENT with my
friends.  I can never tell when he'll fly off the handle and beat
some of them up."
</p>

<p>
"You know why he doesn't like this man.  No father would
like to see his daughter&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?" Martha challenged.
</p>

<p>
"Having her name connected with a married man."
</p>

<p>
"There you go, mother.  You can't find any objection to
him but that."
</p>

<p>
"That's enough for us."
</p>

<p>
"We don't seem to agree."
</p>

<p>
"We've got to, Martha."  Emily felt herself trembling.  She
felt that she was calling to her very child across a great gulf.
The living room with its hideous tableau stretched out distantly,
and Martha and "that man" stood together by the victrola
there, away, away beyond an alienating stretch, and she and
Bob stood together by the door, trying to speak to her.  She
felt it so vividly that her voice touched the angry girl; for
Martha came and sat down by her and said, earnestly:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mammie, I&mdash;I wouldn't quarrel with you for anything.
It doesn't matter about dad.  But you&mdash;mother&mdash;you always
understood me before.  What is the matter now?  Can't you
trust me?  What do you think I'm going to do&mdash;to commit
some crime?"
</p>

<p>
"Martha, you are a child.  You are a young girl, with no
experience.  And I tell you you must be careful.  You mustn't
run risks.  You&mdash;&mdash;  There are so many dangers, child!"
</p>

<p>
"That's just saying those nasty things about him&mdash;to talk
like that&mdash;about danger.  Do you think I'm a fool?  Dad does!"
</p>

<p>
"I think you're&mdash;young, Martha."
</p>

<p>
"That's the same thing when you say it that way, mother.
Honestly, it'll be all right when I tell you!  If you'll call dad
off till next week!"
</p>

<p>
With that much comfort Emily went back to Bob.  And she
lived till the next Monday a trembling flag of truce between
two armies furious to spring into combat.
</p>

<p>
On Friday Martha stayed in bed till late in the morning, and
then came down and said to her mother:
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to Elgin.  Do you want to go with me?"
</p>

<p>
Emily couldn't well go.
</p>

<p>
"I won't be back till three or four.  And I'm going to have
supper with Greta.  You needn't worry about me.  Richard
Quin went to Chicago last night.  I don't want to stay in the
house all day Sunday with father, so I'm going over to-morrow
to Wrights'.  They've asked me.  You don't mind if I go?  I
won't be seeing anybody you object to.  They'll bring me back
Sunday evening."
</p>

<p>
The prospect of another scene between Bob and Martha
was more frightful to Emily than whatever explanation was
forthcoming next week.  She couldn't help believing that in
some way Martha would clear herself from blame.  She wanted
to believe that she was unreasonable, that her daughter was right.
But she would insist on Martha apologizing to Bob as soon as
they both cooled down.  She could always manage Bob, some
way&mdash;by tears, if by nothing else, because she had never
exercised their authority over him; he wasn't used to them.  She
knew he surrendered when one tear showed in her eyes.  And
now since this burden of fear for the child weighed her down,
no feigning was required.  Tears were just there, waiting to
come.  Why couldn't Martha appreciate Bob?  And why should
Bob be irritable only with his poor little daughter?  A man
who was so successful in managing a lot of overalled workmen.
If only Martha had been a boy!  Emily, like Bob, had never
before been sorry she was a girl.  Never!  That is&mdash;except
just now, when she wouldn't get on with her father.
</p>

<p>
By Monday Emily had practically convinced herself that
Martha, by some simple explanation, was about to set everything
right.  They were together in the living room, waiting for
Bob, who was late coming up to dinner.  When he came in he
laid the mail on the table, paper and letters, and immediately
Martha was there, taking hers.
</p>

<p>
"Who're those letters from?" Bob said.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be able to tell after I've opened them," she replied,
because, even with Emily there, their tones said, "Do you get
letters from that damned masher?" and, "What's it to you
whom I get letters from!"
</p>

<p>
Emily interposed.  "Dinner's ready, Bob."  Her presence
begged them not to quarrel.  So Martha took her letters and
went out to the veranda, and Bob went to wash.  And they
sat down at the table without more conflict.  Martha's face
was pink and she ate little.  But she hadn't for some days had
much appetite, as Emily had silently marked.  When they rose
and went into the living room again, Martha shut the dining
room door behind her.  Bob had taken up the daily, and sat
down on the davenport, lighting a cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," said Martha.  At the stillness of her voice Bob
had looked up at her.  She was standing erect at the living-room
table.  She had taken a letter from the front of her little
lavender gingham frock.  Emily sank down beside Bob.
</p>

<p>
"I said I'd tell you something to-day."  Both hands were
clasped breast-high about that letter.  Her shoulders were
atilt.  Her eyes were gleaming.  "I'm afraid you won't like
it."
</p>

<p>
She had spoken gently, with sincerity, with dignity.  She
paused.  She swallowed, trying to go on quietly, but the
words came rushing out.
</p>

<p>
"Richard Quin is getting a divorce!"
</p>

<p>
The joy of the girl sang out in that sentence.  It sang out
through the tenseness of the room as if all the lovers of the
world were there to listen and chorus.  Emily and Bob, for a
second, sat dumfounded, just staring at her.  Then Emily, from
very pity, gave a sort of moan.  And at that sound Bob got up
ominously.  He could hardly find his voice.
</p>

<p>
"What's that to you?  Let me see that letter!" He reached
out for it.
</p>

<p>
Martha stuffed it hastily down the square neck of her frock,
for safety.
</p>

<p>
"It's my letter."  She faced him, and not one of her scornful
eyelashes fluttered at all, though he was glaring at her as if
he would like to tear her into bits.
</p>

<p>
"So this is what you fixed up Friday night, with the blinds
down.  The God-damned scoundrel!  You think you're going
to marry him when he's got one wife?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not discussing it with you.  I won't have him called
names."
</p>

<p>
Emily sobbed, "Bob!" entreatingly.
</p>

<p>
He turned sharply round and looked at her.  And then he
turned passionately towards Martha.
</p>

<p>
"Look at there!" he cried, with a gesture.  "Look at your
mother!  You can't make her cry!"  He was helpless.  He had
to entreat his child.  "You can't do this, Martha!"
</p>

<p>
Martha had gone to her mother while Bob was speaking.  She
had thrown herself down against her, caressingly, trying to
creep into her arms.  But Emily's head was buried in her hands.
She would not let her tear-stained face be uncovered.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want her to cry!  I wouldn't make her cry for
worlds.  I was afraid you wouldn't like it&mdash;at first.  Don't cry,
mammie!  It'll be all right when you know him."  But Emily
wept on.  "He hasn't been happy, mother!" Martha entreated
her.
</p>

<p>
Her words seemed to mock Bob.  He spluttered out his fury.
</p>

<p>
"Happy!  Who gives a damn whether he's happy or not?" he
cried, as if he couldn't believe that his ears had heard such an
inopportune suggestion.  "Emily!  Don't you cry, Emily!  I'll
stop this!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Martha!" Emily moaned.
</p>

<p>
Then Bob cried, suddenly, "Let me see that letter!"
</p>

<p>
Martha got up and spoke quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Mother doesn't want us quarreling," she said.  "You know
that.  It makes her feel worse.  That's my letter and I'm not
going to let you see it.  I won't talk to you now.  You're too
mad.  I'm going upstairs.  You can talk it over together."
</p>

<p>
Bob sat helplessly down near his wife.  He wanted so greatly,
so clumsily to comfort her, that she lifted her face to him.
She wiped her eyes, but her thoughts were too painful.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, did you hear how she said that?  She's in LOVE with
him, Bob!"  She wept again.
</p>

<p>
He answered, shortly: "Well, don't you worry.  If she is,
she'll have to get over it.  What business has she got being in
love with a married man?"
</p>

<p>
"It's too horrible!  It makes me sick.  I see it all now.  She
has been infatuated with him since that first night.  The way
she looked at him&mdash;even then!"
</p>

<p>
"He's a skunk, Emily.  He's a damned skunk.  The nerve
of him, coming down here to tell her he was getting a divorce!
She thinks she's going to marry him.  Why, the girl's a perfect
fool!  I'm going to see Fairbanks about this!  Who is he, anyway?
I'll get the goods on him!  I'll put an end to this, once
for all.  Don't you cry, old girl!  We can't have this going on
any longer!"
</p>

<p>
That was true.  They could not have this going on.  They
considered what to do.  But every time Emily thought of the
child saying that&mdash;of those words "Richard Quin is getting a
divorce"&mdash;as if the words came fresh out of glory, she had to
hold her breath to keep from sobbing.  The poor, silly,
inexperienced girl, caught in this trap of pain.  They sat there
bewilderedly, trying to plan&mdash;to hope&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Then Johnnie Benton knocked on the screen and walked
into the room, as he often did.  He was embarrassed about
something and dead in earnest.  He saw at once that Emily
had been crying.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" he began apologetically.  "I didn't&mdash;&mdash;  I want to see
Martha."
</p>

<p>
Bob, intending naturally to hide the family sorrow from sight,
got up and went to the stairs and called up:
</p>

<p>
"Martha, here's Johnnie."
</p>

<p>
He got no answer, and repeated it shouting.
</p>

<p>
Martha opened her door and answered:
</p>

<p>
"I'm busy.  I haven't got time to see him."
</p>

<p>
"Come in again later," Bob said to him.  "She's dressing,
or something."
</p>

<p>
But Johnnie wasn't satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;I want to&mdash;&mdash;  No.  This is important.  I can't
wait.  I'm in a hurry."
</p>

<p>
Bob shouted up again:
</p>

<p>
"Martha!  Johnnie's in a hurry!  It's something important.
Come on down."
</p>

<p>
Johnnie heard her answer.  Emily heard it.  There was no
misunderstanding it.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not coming down.  I don't want to see him."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going away till I see her."
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" asked Emily, annoyed by his persistence.
He stood there as if he was planted deep in the rug.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Mrs. Kenworthy, I want this announced.  We're
engaged.  Maybe we ought to have told you before, but it's
going to be announced right now."
</p>

<p>
"Who's engaged?" Bob exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Martha and I."
</p>

<p>
"Why, <i>Johnnie</i>!" Emily babbled.  She had suddenly leaned
forward, and was sitting up, looking at the boy.
</p>

<p>
He grew red, but his eyes never wavered under her scrutiny.
He was dead in earnest, for once.  "You ask her to come down,"
he begged.
</p>

<p>
Emily got up slowly.  Was she, then, waking from a hideous
nightmare?  Oh, if it was only some nice boy like Johnnie that
could make the girl's voice shake!
</p>

<p>
"Martha!" she called up, and her voice was so alive with
excitement that Martha came to the top of the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, mother?" she asked, eager for conciliation.
</p>

<p>
"Come down here, Martha!"
</p>

<p>
So Martha came down.  She came into the living room
slowly, warily.  She looked at Johnnie.  She looked at her
mother inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Martha," said Emily, quietly, "Johnnie says&mdash;&mdash;  You tell
her," she said to him.
</p>

<p>
"Martha, we're going to announce our engagement to-day.
Right now!"
</p>

<p>
The girl stood looking at him steadily in composed
disapproval.  "Whom are you engaged to?  Why the excitement?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm engaged to you, Martha."  He wasn't going to be fooled
with.
</p>

<p>
"What a&mdash;&mdash;"  It seemed plain that she was about to say
"lie," but she thought better of dignifying his statement by
emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"What makes you say a thing like that?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"You know very well what makes me say it."
</p>

<p>
Bob could not tolerate her indifference.
</p>

<p>
"Are you engaged to him or not?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"I certainly am not," she said.  "Is that all you wanted?"
she asked her mother.
</p>

<p>
"Now look here, Martha," Johnnie burst out with determination,
"it's time to stop this fooling.  That other thing's
announced.  That's in the paper.  <i>This</i> is going to be announced."
</p>

<p>
"What's in the paper?" Bob cried, suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"Everything except her name.  Everybody knows who it is."  And
Johnnie stopped short in confusion, looking at Emily.
"You were crying&mdash;&mdash;" he pleaded for his excuse, lamely.
"I thought you knew."
</p>

<p>
Bob had jumped for the paper.  "What is it?" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"I thought, of course, you had seen it."  And as Bob urged
him, he pointed to it almost without looking, as if he knew by
heart the very place the words had in their column.  And Bob
read, spluttering, gurgling:
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Richard Quin, who has been visiting her father,
returned this morning to Chicago to start divorce proceedings
against her husband.  She names as corespondent the daughter
of a prominent family of this town."
</p>

<p>
"I thought, of course, you knew," Johnnie murmured.
</p>

<p>
"He did," said Martha.  "I told them."
</p>

<p>
Emily had been to look over Bob's shoulder.  She was
taking the paper into her own hands, as if, unless she looked at
it closely, she could not believe the words.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't tell us THIS!  You said HE was getting the
divorce!"  She had reduced Bob again to spluttering.
</p>

<p>
"What difference does it make?" she murmured.  And Bob
could only echo her words dazedly.  But Johnnie was
challenging her.
</p>

<p>
"As soon as I saw you were in trouble, I made up my mind.
I'm not going to wait any longer."  There was no mistaking
either his words or his tone.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"  And then, "Am I in trouble?"  She spoke with
indifferent curiosity, as if the idea was unimportant to her.
"What trouble am I in?"
</p>

<p>
"My God!" Bob shouted at her.  "Are you in trouble!  Cut
that out, I tell you.  You ought to be thankful to get a decent
man to marry you, after this."
</p>

<p>
She paid no attention to him.  She was still looking
imperturbably at Johnnie.
</p>

<p>
"You think it is a disgrace, I suppose, to have my name
connected with his.  So you come over and offer to marry me.
To give me your precious name!  Are you going into the
movies, Johnnie?"
</p>

<p>
It is altogether likely that Bob, at this point, would have
seized her by the arm and given her that shaking she had been
so long inviting, if into the room just then had not stalked the
cause of Johnnie's haste.  His mother seemed to be perfectly
in tune with the occasion, for she demanded, excitedly, having
looked about and fixed her eyes on Emily:
</p>

<p>
"What has he been saying?  I <i>told</i> you I'd tell the
Kenworthys!  Emily, what has Johnnie been saying to you?"
</p>

<p>
Before Emily could answer, Bob, to save her the trouble,
exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"He says he's engaged to her!"  And then from those four,
Emily being at one side, in less than a minute there came a
volley of sharp sentences, as if they were standing in a circle
firing at a target in the center.
</p>

<p>
Instantly Mrs. Benton exploded:
</p>

<p>
"Well, he isn't!  He can't be!  I will NOT give my consent!
He can't stop school.  He never earned a cent in his life.  I
won't allow him to marry!  Understand that!"
</p>

<p>
Johnnie, ignoring her, cried to Bob, "I CAN earn my living!"
</p>

<p>
"You can't!" Mrs. Benton fired on him.  "I will NOT support
your wife!"
</p>

<p>
"Who asked you to?" Bob demanded.  "I'll give you a job,
Johnnie!  I'll see you don't starve!"
</p>

<p>
And crack! crack!  Martha spoke quietly, scornfully, to
Mrs. Benton: "You needn't worry!  I have not the least
intention of marrying him!"
</p>

<p>
"You will marry him!" Bob popped.  "You'll drop that
skunk and marry him, or you'll get out of this house.  I'm not
going to stand any more nonsense from you!"
</p>

<p>
A fusillade from the heavy artillery.
</p>

<p>
"Whose house is this, anyway, Bob Kenworthy?  What right
have you got to turn anyone out of it?  If I was Emily I'd
turn YOU out for saying such a thing!  I tell you I won't have
Martha to support!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you worry!  I don't feel the need of you for my
mother-in-law!"  Martha Kenworthy dared to turn directly to
her father.  "This'll be my house some day, and I'll turn you
all out if I want to!"
</p>

<p>
Emily, still holding that staggering newspaper in her hand,
heard these dangerous sentences bursting around her child;
they weren't saving her&mdash;they were destroying her.  A panic
took possession of her&mdash;and fury.  And she rose with almost a
jump and seized Martha by the arm.  These four sharpshooters
saw something that they had never seen before.  Anger unused
for many years cuts sharp.  Emily, with it, mowed them down.
</p>

<p>
"Keep still!" she cried to Martha.  "Don't say another word!
I'm ashamed of you!  Go up to your room, and don't you come
down till you apologize!"  But she stood holding her tightly
by the arm and glaring about her.  Her eyes were fixed on
Mrs. Benton.  "You stand there saying things as if you could unsay
them!  A nice example you set these children!"  She turned
to Bob.  "Isn't this MY house?"  Bob Kenworthy had never
been asked in all his married life before to acknowledge that
fact.  "And you come here," she went on, furiously, to Cora
Benton, "and turn people out of it!"
</p>

<p>
She stopped, and from sheer amazement no one uttered a
word.  She glared at them all.
</p>

<p>
"Johnnie, you go home!  You're the only one that seems to
have any sense left!  I don't know whether we're fit for you
to associate with!  You better turn Bob out of the garage, and
I'll turn your mother out of her house, and we'll be done with
it!"  And she sent her dumfounded daughter upstairs with an
unmistakable gesture.
</p>

<p>
Johnnie went slowly out of the front door.

<h3>
<i>Chapter Five</i>
</h3>

<p>
Emily turned upon the subdued adults in front of her.  She
spoke first to Bob.
</p>

<p>
"You call Martha a fool!  You say that <i>she's</i> foolish!  If I
ever saw anything in my life to equal you two!  I should think
you'd be glad Johnnie wants to marry a nice girl like Martha!"
she cried to Mrs. Benton.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not objecting to Martha, Emily; you know that.  He
hasn't any business to begin talking about marriage at his age!
A nice husband he would make for anybody.  He never earned a
cent in his life; you know that."  She spoke guardedly now.
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't he be thinking about marriage at his age?
It's exactly the age he would think about it!  I tell you they
could both do a lot worse than this.  I wish she would marry
him.  But you went and told her to, Bob.  You're a perfect
idiot, sometimes.  She'll never marry him now."
</p>

<p>
"She'll never get anybody to marry her if she don't watch her
step.  Getting mixed up in cases like this!"
</p>

<p>
"You don't need to worry about this case, Emily," Mrs. Benton
announced.  "I'll settle that.  I told Johnnie he needn't
get so excited.  Everybody in town will know, the minute they
see that item, that French put it there for spite, because we did
build our parking place there.  I'm going to make him apologize.
I'm going to call my committee together at once.  The family
of every woman on it is not going to be at the mercy of that
unscrupulous man.  First Johnnie's play; then this about
Martha.  Johnnie says she's only played golf a little with him.
I'm going straight down to his office.  I've got to go before
Johnnie gets there.  He wants to fight him, of course!"  She
actually started towards the door.
</p>

<p>
"You keep your hands off this case!" Bob cried at her,
looking at Emily.
</p>

<p>
She faced about angrily towards him.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to have an understanding with that man!"  But
she too stopped to look at Emily.
</p>

<p>
"You leave this to me!  It's none of your business!" Bob
commanded, excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"It certainly <i>is</i> my business, and I'm going to see about
it!"  She turned defiantly to go.
</p>

<p>
But Emily rushed between her and the door, and she was
desperate.  If Cora Benton knew all the truth, would she dare
to ask for an apology?
</p>

<p>
"This is my case!" she cried, "If you take it up I'll never
speak to you again as long as I live!  I'll go over to French!
I'll go over to the other side!  And if you promise me now&mdash;that
you won't&mdash;not say a word to him till we think it over,
I tell you I'll never let Martha marry Johnnie!  I'll get him to
go back to college!  I'll persuade him!  Honestly, Cora!  Bob,
go and stop Johnnie!  Find out where he is!  Don't let him do
anything!"
</p>

<p>
He obeyed.  Standing at the screen door, the two women
watched him hurry down the street.  Emily turned her head
suddenly, hearing a strange noise.  Could Mrs. Benton be
sniffling?  Yes.  Into those kingly black eyes suddenly tears came
springing.
</p>

<p>
"Emily&mdash;I feel&mdash;bad about this!  I'm sorry for you!  I know
how I felt when I saw&mdash;about Johnnie&mdash;in that paper.  And it's
worse for a girl!"
</p>

<p>
"Cora, honestly, I don't think Martha intends marrying
Johnnie.  I only wish she did!"
</p>

<p>
"You aren't worried about her, Emily?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh <i>yes</i>!  I'm worried.  I'm&mdash;sick&mdash;about this, Cora.  Don't
say a word to anyone yet!  I'll tell you all about it.  I'll tell
you what to say to people for me&mdash;as soon as I can!  I haven't
had time&mdash;even to talk to her yet&mdash;since I saw it in the paper!
Martha'll apologize to you, Cora; I'm sure she will!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't worry about that, Emily!  I know just how you
feel!  Haven't I cried myself to sleep often enough about that
boy to understand!"
</p>

<p>
Emily had opened her red eyes in astonishment at this statement.
</p>

<p>
"You might be thankful she's a girl.  I'll tell you now,
Emily, since this has happened&mdash;that I've told Johnnie plainly
if he doesn't settle down and do some work next term, I'll never
leave him a cent.  I'll leave my money to charity.  I'd rather
leave it to the town council to manage.  When I think of the
man my father was&mdash;&mdash;"  She spoke sniffling, wiping her eyes
angrily.  Emily had to comfort her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, Cora, he's young yet."
</p>

<p>
"No, he isn't young.  He's at least two years behind most
boys.  He ought to have finished college two years ago.  Look
at Jim Black.  Look at Wilton!  I tried to have a serious talk
with him when he came home.  If only he'd take something
seriously.  Why can't he take up medicine?  I asked him why
he wouldn't take up law and go into politics.  And he said
maybe he would.  He said, Emily, 'Look where Landis got to
by being a lawyer!'"  She almost sobbed.  "He meant that
horrid federation of baseball clubs.  He was serious about
that."
</p>

<p>
"But, Cora, he is a good boy.  He has a nice disposition."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes.  I know what people say.  He needs it, they say,
to live with me.  But they never think what patience <i>I</i> need.
Emily, I'd be ashamed to tell you how much he spent last year.
I don't know what to do with him.  I can't threaten to take
him out of college&mdash;he doesn't want to go back, anyway.  He'll
<i>have</i> to go back!  He's just <i>got</i> to get his degree.  And now
Bob goes and encourages him.  He says he'll support him!"
</p>

<p>
"Cora, Bob was just excited.  He didn't mean that.  He
wouldn't support him a minute, really.  He lost his head,
really."
</p>

<p>
"Well, so did I.  I acknowledge that.  But it's a nice thing to
have him telling me not to interfere.  As if it was none of my
business when my own boy married.  I've got a headache, Emily.
I had a bad night.  He brought me my breakfast himself and
was so nice about everything.  And then&mdash;I was napping&mdash;he
tore into the room with the paper in his hand and said he was
going to get married right away&mdash;the first I'd heard of it.
And he wouldn't listen to me.  He acted awful.  I just got up
and dressed and came over this way."  She made a gesture
towards the old blue foulard she had slipped on.  Her hair
wasn't so brushed and shining as usual, and her face was lined
now, and her eyes red.  "I thought I ought to tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Cora, why don't you go and see a doctor in Chicago?  You
aren't well.  You are tired out, and he oughtn't to have excited
you this way.  I think you ought to go home and go to bed,
and I'll come over and tell you later everything Bob says to
French.  I'll talk to Johnnie, too.  I think Bob will be sorry
he said such things, Cora, when he cools down."
</p>

<p>
"He'd better cool down.  The idea of him speaking to
Martha that way!  I felt sorry for her, and for you too, Emily.
It's bad enough to have to try to raise a child without a father
to interfere all the time.  You've got them both on your hands
to manage."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about that!" Emily started to protest, loyally.
They were standing face to face in front of the screen door, and
they saw Eve drive up and come towards them.  She had been
crying, too.  She spoke to them quietly, going into the living
room.  Mrs. Benton went away, and Emily came in and sat
down by her, and almost at once Eve had insinuated herself into
Emily's arms, crying:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't blame <i>me</i> for this, Mrs. Kenworthy.  I <i>told</i>
Martha this would happen.  I told her as sure as she lived
something like this would happen."
</p>

<p>
"Something like what?  Don't cry, child!"
</p>

<p>
Bob was coming in.
</p>

<p>
"We&mdash;&mdash;, I've settled Johnnie," he announced.  And then
he saw Eve, and the sight displeased him.
</p>

<p>
"What do you know about this?" he demanded, shortly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't blame <i>me</i>!  I <i>did</i> tell her!  I told her it would happen.
Maybe I didn't tell her enough."
</p>

<p>
"Enough what?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean&mdash;I didn't tell her, really, it had happened before."
</p>

<p>
"What had?"  Bob scorned vagueness.
</p>

<p>
"I told her my sister was&mdash;jealous.  I told her she couldn't
stand that pig even looking at a woman.  I told her if he did,
she was sure to make a row.  She's done this before."
</p>

<p>
"What has she done before?"
</p>

<p>
"Once before she got jealous&mdash;of a girl&mdash;and she threatened
to&mdash;divorce him."
</p>

<p>
"You mean&mdash;she named her&mdash;as a corespondent?"  Bob had
no scruples about cross-examining this witness.
</p>

<p>
"She threatened to.  She hadn't any case, really.  Oh!"
Eve cried to Emily.  "You didn't like me for not liking her.
You thought I&mdash;said&mdash;nasty things about her&mdash;because she was
my sister.  If you knew what I might have said, you wouldn't
have always been looking at me that way&mdash;as if I was a sort
of underbred scrub!  I tell you she's despicable!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Eve!" Emily protested.
</p>

<p>
"What's she done?" cried Bob, eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she's awful!  Look at this dirty work.  Dad'll make
her apologize.  I know he will, Mrs. Kenworthy.  I've
telegraphed for him to come home.  He'll come right away.  He'll
think grandma's dying."
</p>

<p>
"What?" cried Bob.  "What'll he do, Eve?"
</p>

<p>
"I know dad'll settle it.  I know he will.  She never meant
to divorce him.  She just wants to frighten Martha because
she's got money."
</p>

<p>
"You mean&mdash;&mdash;  Isn't she going to divorce him?" Bob insisted.
</p>

<p>
"No.  Don't you ever think she is!  Oh&mdash;&mdash;" cried Eve,
in bitter humiliation, as if now she was compelled to confess the
worst, "Mrs. Kenworthy, she&mdash;she LOVES that pig!  You
Wouldn't believe it, maybe.  She cries herself sick if he looks
at anybody!  And ever since she heard that Martha's got money
she's been just wild."
</p>

<p>
"What's that got to do with it?"
</p>

<p>
An outraged parent on either side of Eve was trying to
grasp the situation.
</p>

<p>
"She knows he won't&mdash;leave her, or anything, for anybody
without any money.  She thinks Martha's going to be awfully
rich.  I didn't know how much she was going to have.  <i>I</i>
couldn't tell her."
</p>

<p>
Emily sat silenced by the very vileness of life.  To think
of Martha's money, her great-grandfather's hard-earned money,
lying there accumulating through those years of her sweet
childhood, to become now a factor in this&mdash;pollution of her.
Pollution, pollution, said Emily to herself.
</p>

<p>
Bob demanded, suddenly, "Has she got a lot of money?"
</p>

<p>
"Only what she squeezes out of dad.  She gets a lot.  I don't
know how much he gives her.  She just bleeds him," she cried,
angrily.  "Look here, Mrs. Kenworthy, YOU know dad.  You
know what a darling he is!  I get so mad at her I could just
kill her, the way she treats him.  You wouldn't believe it.
Didn't you ever read 'King Lear'?  Didn't you read <i>Père
Goriot</i>?  You wouldn't think there were such men in the world.
But dad's just like them.  He's worse.  Look how he lives.  He
was rich when I was a little girl; he had a great business
exporting flour.  My grandfather had had it, and it went bust after
the war.  He hadn't a cent.  And now look at him starting all
over, knocking around from town to town, buying grain and
elevators, in these filthy hotels.  He never has one comfort!
He never spends one cent on himself.  He keeps that house&mdash;an
asylum it is, for grandma.  He keeps me, but I don't spend
a lot of money.  I'm going to work the very minute I get out of
school.  SHE spends it all; she comes home with a new lie
whenever she's hard up.  He brought her up to have a lot of money,
he says.  He's sorry for her.  She hadn't a mother and she
didn't get started right, he says.  She divorced her first
husband."
</p>

<p>
"She did, did she!" Bob cried.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Of course, dad took her part in that, too.  I don't
know the truth of it; I was a little girl!"
</p>

<p>
"Eve," said Emily, hesitating, "I wish&mdash;you'd tell us what
happened&mdash;how this happened before, if you don't mind."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't mind.  It was after the war.  We didn't have
any home at all.  I was in a boarding school, and my aunt asked
me there for the vacation summer.  She wasn't my own aunt;
she was the wife of my mother's brother.  Oh, they had the
loveliest house, and all just full of fun; and they were so gentle
and so kind&mdash;just like you, Mrs. Kenworthy.  My cousins were
all grown up, and they were just lovely to me.  And then my
sister turned up, for a week or two, with HIM.  And of course
she couldn't stand one of the girls even looking at her precious
pig.  And there was one of those girls, the one I liked best of
all, of course.  And she&mdash;sort of named her&mdash;just like this, so
she wouldn't get into trouble&mdash;-didn't mention her name.  And
of course dad came and denied it&mdash;but what good did that do?
All of them were furious, naturally.  It's a little old town of
Friends.  It wasn't my fault.  I've never been invited back
since.  People like me when they don't know my sister.  But
I can't get away from her any place.  This'll be all over school.
It'll get back to that town.  I know the girls from there at
college.  I tell you honestly&mdash;poor dad'll feel just sick about
this.  And the next time she turns up with a hard-luck story
he'll take it all in again.  He bought them a house&mdash;a good
one&mdash;because she hadn't any home&mdash;in Philadelphia.  And she sold
it&mdash;and went to Paris.  He told me they wouldn't be here this
summer, if I came out to him.  He's so sentimental.  He just
begins talking about mother when I try to get him to kick them
out I'm never going to speak to her again, or stay one night
in the same house with her.  You mark my words, he'll have
to choose between having her or me."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you worry, Eve.  Nobody's going to blame you for
anything."  Bob spoke kindly because her sincere little tribute
to Emily had, of course, touched him.  "I'll see your father
about this.  What time will he be here?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you don't need to see him.  He'll do it himself.  I
know he will.  We'll come down and see you about it.  Don't
say anything to hurt his feelings, will you, Mr. Kenworthy?
Because it isn't his fault.  He's a good, good man.  I
mean&mdash;he'll feel worse about this than anyone"&mdash;&mdash;she looked at
Emily&mdash;and added, "almost."
</p>

<p>
After she had gone, Emily roused herself.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't seem as if that could be true, does it, Bob?  How
would a woman DARE to do a thing like that?  She might get
into trouble&mdash;sued."
</p>

<p>
"She didn't use anybody's name.  If Martha hadn't&mdash;been
running around with that man, this couldn't have hurt her."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;why, maybe she doesn't intend to divorce him at all!
Eve said she didn't, didn't she?"  And then Emily remembered
Martha's exalted announcement.  "Suppose she doesn't divorce
him!" she moaned.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that'd settle it.  I think I'll go downtown&mdash;as if
nothing had happened.  As if I didn't know who was meant.  I'll
go and see what Mrs. Benton's doing.  I better make sure she
isn't&mdash;balling it all up."
</p>

<p>
"Let her alone, Bob.  She promised me not to do anything;
not ANYthing.  I'm sure she won't.  She isn't feeling well
enough to do anything.  She's sick, for one thing.  She isn't
well enough to go downtown."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's one piece of luck!"
</p>

<p>
"You were hard on her, Bob."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what did she want to walk in here for?  Why can't
she mind her own business?"
</p>

<p>
"It <i>is</i> her business.  As she said Johnnie's <i>her</i> boy."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't got anything against that kid, Emily.  But I'd
hate to have her for my mother-in-law.  My God!  What would
the boy do between those two&mdash;Martha and that woman?"
</p>

<p>
"You needn't worry about that.  Martha'll never marry him
now."
</p>

<p>
"What you going to do with her now, Emily?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"'Tisn't as if she had good sense!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, maybe she hasn't.  But I'll tell you one thing, Bob.
We're not going to have any more melodrama about turning
anybody out of this house.  If Martha goes out of it, I go with
her.  You might as well understand that.  She needs me more
than you do.  And she's going to have me, no matter what she
does.  No matter who she marries.  If people talk about her,
they've got to talk about me."
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean that, Emily.  You'd never leave me.  You're
just talking wild."
</p>

<p>
"I'll never leave her!  That's sure."
</p>

<p>
"I guess I got sort of excited, Emily.  I know this is
your home.  I didn't mean anything&mdash;much.  I'm going to see
Fairbanks.  I'll do all I can, Emily.  It's a dirty mess for you,
that she's got herself in."
</p>

<p>
"But the worst of it is&mdash;she's in love, Bob!"
</p>

<p>
"She'll have to get over it; that's all there is to it."
</p>

<p>
It seemed so simple to Bob.  Emily sat still for a minute,
thinking batteredly, after he went.  She was thinking that she
must be careful.  She would think it all over, all this sickening
confusion, before she went up to talk to Martha.  But Martha
apparently had been listening for her father's departure.  For
no sooner had his car started away than she called down,
eagerly:
</p>

<p>
"Mammie!  Come up here."
</p>

<p>
And she met her at the top of the stairs, and they went
together into Emily's room, the nearer one.  Inside the door
Martha came close to her mother, taking her hand, and saying,
gently:
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry I was so nasty to Mrs. Benton, mammie.  I'll
go and tell her so, if you want me to.  You aren't really
ashamed of me, are you?  Mammie, now that everything's
settled, will you do something for me?  Will you ask him down
here?  Won't you try to get acquainted with him, mother?
Won't you stop crying about it?  You'll just love him, mother!"
</p>

<p>
They had sat down together on the bed.  Emily was dazed by
this beginning.
</p>

<p>
"Don't look at me that way; it isn't fair, mammie.  I'll
even&mdash;  Look here!  I'll apologize to Johnnie, if you want me to.  I
suppose he meant well."  And when Emily still said nothing:
"Mother, if you make me, I'll even tell dad I'm sorry.  But you
heard what he said!  You heard him tell me I HAD to marry
Johnnie.  You see <i>now</i> what sort of a man he is!  But if you
really want me to, of course, I'll&mdash;forgive him.  I don't want
to make you&mdash;miserable.  You'd understand, if you knew
him&mdash;if you'd ask him to come down here so you could get to
know him."
</p>

<p>
The child WAS crazy!  To ask a thing like that!  To suppose
for a moment that her mother&mdash;&mdash;  What shall I say to
her? Emily wondered.  What's the use of trying to talk to her?
The gulf between them seemed to be widening every minute.
</p>

<p>
"You don't know what you're saying, child!  Why,
Martha&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what, mammie?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, he&mdash;is <i>married</i>!  He isn't divorced.  I don't know
that he ever will be!  And you ask me&mdash;NOW&mdash;to invite
him&mdash;&mdash;"  Emily was unable to go on.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course he is married&mdash;in a way, mother.  But that
isn't anything.  If you knew how unhappy he'd been with her,
mammie!  She isn't a nice woman.  You don't call THAT any
marriage, do you?  Why, it's nothing but a legal contract!"
</p>

<p>
"But, Martha, a legal contract is SOMETHING&mdash;if it is only
that."
</p>

<p>
"It's only the law of marriage, mother.  There's no heart
in it.  It isn't real!  It&mdash;isn't&mdash;mother&mdash;when they don't love
each other."
</p>

<p>
"Eve says she does love him!  <i>Her</i> heart may be in it."
</p>

<p>
"Eve!"
</p>

<p>
"Eve doesn't think she intends to divorce him at all, Martha."
</p>

<p>
"She doesn't know anything about it."  Martha lifted her
head proudly again.
</p>

<p>
"Martha, tell me what you know about it.  Did he tell you
your name was going to be mentioned?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  He didn't know that.  But you needn't worry about
that, mother.  I consider it an honor.  I don't mind it, if it
gets him his freedom&mdash;if it makes him happy."
</p>

<p>
"He must have known this was liable to happen.  Eve says
it has happened before."
</p>

<p>
"What business is it of Eve's?  She's trying to make trouble.
What did she come down here for, anyway now, mother?"
</p>

<p>
What was the use of talking to this undone child?
</p>

<p>
"She says her father will stop it.  He'll make her apologize."
</p>

<p>
"Stop what?"
</p>

<p>
"The divorce.  Having your name in it."
</p>

<p>
"Mother!" Martha cried out, poignantly.  And then she
recovered herself instantly.  "It doesn't matter; he'll have his
freedom.  He can divorce her, if she won't divorce him.  Maybe
she won't; it would be just like her.  But, look here, mother,
why can't Eve let it alone?  What's she got against him?  She
has it in for him.  She's got to let this alone."
</p>

<p>
"She was thinking of you&mdash;of us all."
</p>

<p>
"Why doesn't some one think of him?  You never think of
him.  You never care what happens to him.  You're just afraid
of people talking!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm afraid of it&mdash;of people talking&mdash;about you."
</p>

<p>
"But you always understood before.  You always said&mdash;Oh,
I can't make you understand!" she cried, and was silent.
</p>

<p>
"Martha, if it was any other man, any unmarried man&mdash;you
were&mdash;your name was&mdash;connected with, I wouldn't mind.  If
it was even a&mdash;married man&mdash;I&mdash;could&mdash;have any respect for, I
wouldn't have cared so much.  Not even if it had been the
Legion!  But I don't want you to&mdash;<i>think</i> about this man, even.
I don't care how much he's divorced and single!  If he was
a decent man, he would have come to us about this first&mdash;if he
had to speak to anybody about it while he's still&mdash;bound to
his wife.  If he was a straightforward man, or honest, he
would have asked us!"
</p>

<p>
"Mother, that's bunk!  That's not fair.  Whoever asks a
girl's people first now?  That's Victorian.  You didn't even
do it yourself, when you were young.  You told me you went
to Chicago and married dad when your aunt didn't even know
where you were!  Did dad ever ask your aunt first if he could
marry you?"
</p>

<p>
"That's different."
</p>

<p>
"Did he, now?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he didn't.  But I knew him; I knew his mother; I
knew his family, and everything."
</p>

<p>
"Well, come with me to Chicago and ask him about his
family," Martha pleaded.  "If you think there's anything
disgraceful about it, we could go to some place&mdash;some hotel&mdash;on
the west side&mdash;where nobody'd have to know anything
about it."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Martha Kenworthy!"
</p>

<p>
"Look here, mammie!  I'm not going to quarrel with you!
I've quarreled with everybody else.  If you'll just try to be
reasonable.  I'm not asking you to promise you'll like him, or
anything; I just ask you to get acquainted with him.  I know
you'd like him.  Just hear his side of it once.  You said you
felt sorry for people that were unhappy&mdash;with their wives.
You said you thought Mrs. Green ought to get a divorce,
mother.  That night Helen was here, when we were sitting on
the porch.  You said yourself that such a marriage wasn't
anything.  Mother, you always said that.  You pitied other
people."
</p>

<p>
"I pity Eve's sister, too."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but why don't you pity HIM?  Because you don't know
him!  You won't even try to get to know him.  It isn't fair,
mother!"
</p>

<p>
"How can I think of him?  I'm thinking of you!"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that's natural."  Martha was determined to be
conciliatory.  She searched about for some effective argument.
"Mammie," she said, lovingly, "you just look tired out.  I
just hate to see you worrying this way.  Especially when you
don't really need to.  Mammie, do you want me to go now to
Mrs. Benton's?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!  Wait a little; wait till&mdash;Mr. Fairbanks gets home."
</p>

<p>
"What's he got to do with it?"
</p>

<p>
"Eve says&mdash;he'll take your name out of it."
</p>

<p>
"My name wasn't in the paper."
</p>

<p>
"Eve said&mdash;if she really meant to&mdash;go on with it&mdash;she could
name some one else&mdash;if she needed to."
</p>

<p>
"That's just like Eve to say that."  Martha left the room
with dignity.
</p>

<p>
And Emily sat on her bed, too stunned to change her position.
All her life her lazy body had turned away from emotional
necessities.  She had never been able to get really angry
without feeling physically exhausted afterwards.  And now she
couldn't think clearly.  She was conscious only of horror&mdash;of
the pain of fear.  Martha wasn't going to be happy.  Martha
was going to suffer over this.  Martha was running eagerly,
irrevocably, into the arms of tragedy.  Surely this couldn't
have happened to HER child&mdash;to that good little, sweet, dear
child who had always been just pure joy.  She sat there crying
out against the truth&mdash;she sat there, not moving&mdash;groping
about&mdash;-praying to Fate.
</p>

<p>
She sat there till Martha came in again, fresh and beautiful
from her bath.  She gave a little cry of protest, catching sight
of her mother.
</p>

<p>
"Don't sit there that way.  Don't look that way, mammie.
The world isn't coming to an end because of any old dirty
newspaper."  She stroked her mother's head entreatingly.  And
then she said&mdash;the foolish child&mdash;"It's really beginning, if
you look at it right."  Again her voice quivered with its ecstasy.
She stood trying to coax Emily.  "You lie down awhile, mother.
And go and wash your face.  Shall I bring you some water?
Do you mind, mammie, if I go and play golf?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do.  Wait, Martha, until Mr. Fairbanks comes
back&mdash;until it's settled."
</p>

<p>
"All right, if you'd rather.  Is there anything you want
me to do for supper?"
</p>

<p>
Supper!  What was supper?  The details of ordinary life
seemed to have faded into nothing.
</p>

<p>
"I think everything is&mdash;ready," Emily murmured, getting up.
</p>

<p>
Martha came upstairs after a little while.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Fairbanks is downstairs, mammie.  He wants to see us
all.  Mammie, don't!"  She thought better of protesting against
her mother's expression.  "Go and wash up; put on something.
I'll 'phone dad."
</p>

<p>
Emily, bestirring herself, heard Martha at the upper 'phone
saying to Bob that her mother wanted to see him a minute.
She refrained from mentioning Mr. Fairbanks' name.  Her
voice suggested anything but scandal and tears.  She waited
in her mother's room, and when Emily would have gone down
she urged her to wait till Bob came.  Emily was too tired to
protest, and went down with Martha only when they heard
the car arrive.
</p>

<p>
She looked at Eve's father with intensified curiosity, since
he was the man who seemed to hold Martha's destiny carelessly
in his hand.  His appearance flatly denied his daughter's account
of him.  Could a red-faced, hawk-nosed, round-chinned,
jovial-looking bald-head be a cursing Lear or a bleeding Goriot?  He
was extremely well dressed.  His rotundity suggested pleasure
in steaks and chops.  His voice belied his appearance as
surprisingly as his daughter had.  For when he began to
speak&mdash;he remained standing, and he kept stroking the back of his
shiny head&mdash;-Emily immediately thought he must be a man of
extraordinary reserve, of powerful self-control.  "Martha must
respect what he says!" she thought.  "He CAN help us."
</p>

<p>
"This is a very unpleasant affair, Kenworthy," he began,
smoothly.  "I left Eve crying her eyes out.  She wanted to
come with me, but I wouldn't have it.  I don't know what
she's said to you, but it probably wasn't&mdash;correct&mdash;altogether.
You HAVE been good to her, Mrs. Kenworthy.  My girls&mdash;Eve
especially&mdash;have got to depend too much on friends like
you.  I mean&mdash;I was worried, I was&mdash;uncomfortable because I
couldn't arrange&mdash;something for her here, in this town&mdash;like
what you've meant to her, but she's so hard to suit.  I can't
arrange anything for her&mdash;I can't buy or rent her friends.  I
can't make her like any sensible woman.  I can't tell you how
relieved I was to have her take to you so&mdash;from the first.  She
says now&mdash;she says people will see some&mdash;reference to you&mdash;to
Martha&mdash;in this&mdash;item in the paper.  I don't see that that
follows.  I don't see why they should.  But of course I went
to see the editor at once&mdash;just in case&mdash;you were&mdash;upset."  He
looked closely at Emily.  He saw she had been crying.  He
looked at Martha, more shrewdly, and felt relieved that she
showed no sign of concern.  "I must say he was decent about
it.  Very reasonable, I found him.  Though young Benton
said there was some sort of spite work behind it."
</p>

<p>
"What's he done about it?" Bob demanded.
</p>

<p>
"He's denying it in to-morrow's paper.  He's saying it was
a mistake."
</p>

<p>
He could not help realizing how intently the three of them
were waiting his words.
</p>

<p>
"I ought to explain&mdash;I suppose I ought to tell you&mdash;how
things are with my married daughter&mdash;with
Elinor&mdash;Mrs. Kenworthy.  You'll understand
my situation.  She's a very
sick woman.  She suffers&mdash;&mdash;" the pain in his voice told too
well how she suffered.  "She walks the floor for hours together
at night.  Eve can't understand it.  She's never had a pain in
her life.  I know positively that for three days and nights
before she went to Chicago she hadn't an hour's sleep.  If
you could see&mdash;the fight she&mdash;puts up&mdash;against&mdash;drugs&mdash;against
things to relieve her, Mrs. Kenworthy!"
</p>

<p>
Emily had to murmur, moved by his voice, "Oh, I didn't
realize she was so bad!"
</p>

<p>
"I told the paper man.  I explained it to him&mdash;I didn't
mention your name, even, or any women's clubs.  I told him she
had been&mdash;just beside herself with pain, and if she ever said
any such thing, she didn't know what she was doing.  Because,
you understand, Mrs. Kenworthy," he cried, eagerly, "she
isn't that sort of woman.  She never would have published
such a statement if she had intended doing anything.  I told
him that if she ever saw such a thing in his paper, I didn't
know what she might do.  It would drive her crazy.  I told
him he would be responsible&mdash;for a great deal&mdash;too much harm,
perhaps.  He understood at once.  He said he was sorry.  He
let me word it.  I'll show you."
</p>

<p>
He took a folded sheet of paper out of an inside pocket of
his coat, and handed it to Emily.  Bob went to her, bending
over her chair, and read with her:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
There is no truth whatever in the rumor that Mrs. Richard Quin
contemplates divorce proceedings.
The editor regrets its publication the
more because Mrs. Quin is in very poor health
and in no condition to
bear the annoyance caused by such rumors.
She and her husband left
the first of the week for Rochester,
where she will be under the care of
the Mayos for some weeks.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I don't know&mdash;what more you could have done," Emily
murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Are you satisfied, Martha?"  Mr. Fairbanks was taking the
paper from Emily and handing it to the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, me?" she asked, innocently, as if he had surprised her
by supposing she was concerned in the matter.  Emily, looking
quickly across at her, marked the way her eyes were shining,
and murmured, "Martha!" imploringly.
</p>

<p>
But Martha paid no heed to her.  She tilted her head dangerously
and, looking straight at him, drawled with utter contempt
and scorn:
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you never consider <i>his</i> happiness at all!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Fairbanks grew redder.  He fairly blinked.  He stood
looking at her indignantly for a moment of silence.  Emily
wondered if he now would break forth and give Martha a
thoroughly good "dressing down."
</p>

<p>
But when he began speaking, his words were soft and suave.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm more or less responsible for HER happiness,
Martha.  I'm not for his.  I pay him.  He's necessary to her&mdash;she's
very affectionate, really.  I pay him to contribute to her
happiness, just as I pay for my mother's nurses."  He spoke
slowly.  Obviously he wanted to consider himself a fair man,
always.  "And I can't say," he went on, carefully, "that he
always plays the game.  Sometimes I think she would be
happier without him.  He doesn't&mdash;&mdash;  Sometimes, that is, I
wonder if he's worth&mdash;&mdash;"  He hesitated.
</p>

<p>
So Martha completed his sentence for him.
</p>

<p>
"What you pay him?" she asked, and the finish of her
insolence made even Emily, harassed as she was, wonder where
she had ever learned the tone.  For, looking straight at him,
she got up and deliberately started to leave the room.
Mr. Fairbanks, it seemed, was not afraid of girls, for he put out
his arm and took hold of hers, intending to detain her.  She
broke away angrily as he spoke her name gently, and, standing
in the door into the hall, he watched her sail defiantly up the
stairs.
</p>

<p>
He turned around; he looked from Emily to Bob.  They,
watching him sharply, saw consternation slowly gain control of
his face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" he murmured.  "He hasn't&mdash;you don't think&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He could no longer look at Emily.  He addressed his mumblings
to Bob.  "I didn't realize&mdash;&mdash;  Eve said something, but I
didn't&mdash;think it amounted to anything."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what can we do now?" Emily moaned.
</p>

<p>
Then Bob cried, "The damned skunk!"
</p>

<p>
"Kenworthy!  You must be&mdash;careful!  That's why Elinor's
teeth ache!"  His earnestness startled them.  "Elinor's teeth
are all out, but they all still ache!  It's nerves.  They call it
hysteria!  They can't do anything for her.  Not in Europe,
even.  It's because she fell in love with that first scoundrel.
He broke her heart, as they say.  She lived with him two years,
and there was nothing left of her.  They mean he broke her
nerve, her temper, her character&mdash;everything!  I tell you she
was a magnificent girl, Kenworthy!  She had more common
sense than any girl I ever saw!  She was a partner to me,
more than a daughter.  And there's nothing left of her but
toothache!  I wouldn't have&mdash;anything&mdash;happen to Martha!"
</p>

<p>
He was so distressed that Emily heard herself saying: "Oh,
<i>she'll</i> be all right.  Martha's all right.  Don't worry."
</p>

<p>
"But they take it so hard.  They fall so in earnest.  Look
here, Mrs. Kenworthy, you don't want him around&mdash;in town,
do you?  You want him to clear out?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes!"
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then.  He won't come back.  I won't let him
set foot in this town again.  There are some limits to what
I'll stand from him."
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to see him?  Where is he now?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"I think he's with Elinor.  You never can know, exactly.
But I'll see him."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him for me that if he doesn't let Martha alone, I'll kill
him&mdash;married or divorced."
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell him something worse than that!  You needn't
worry."  He spoke grimly.  A smile that was surprisingly
evil came over his round face.  "I'd like to tell you what I did
to the first man.  It would comfort you.  But it's a secret."
</p>

<p>
Emily shivered.  She didn't like Eve's "sweet old lamb."  He
was a wolf, perhaps, at heart, and she was afraid of his
cruelty.  "He'll make that man afraid, too, if he looks at him
like that!" she thought.
</p>

<p>
He left abruptly, and Emily went upstairs to Martha.  What
she saw in the painted room terrified her.  She had to realize
that the fire in Martha's heart burned passionately enough to
make everything its fuel.  For when she shut the door behind
her, Martha raised herself up angrily from the day bed crying
furiously:
</p>

<p>
"Mother!  I hope you're satisfied <i>now</i>!  I don't know how
you could sit there with that vile man!  Did you ever hear
anything so&mdash;vile&mdash;vile!"  She sobbed.  "He talks as if Richard
was a dog to amuse that dirty woman!  You'd think he was a
slave!  Nobody takes his part!  Nobody cares for him!  And
YOU aren't sorry for him, even!  Oh, it makes me so mad!"
</p>

<p>
After a little Emily said, "I felt sorry for HER, Martha!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you <i>would</i>!  You <i>know</i> what a liar she is.  Even Eve
said she was a liar.  Even Eve said she pretended to be sick
so she could get money out of her father!  Why do you believe
them?  Oh!" cried Martha, "he's a vile man!  Vile!  When I
think of Richard having to live with those people&mdash;&mdash;"  When
her sobs let her speak, she went on, "Mother, can't you see
what a position he is in?"
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't seem a position that does any man any credit,
Martha."
</p>

<p>
"All right!" cried Martha.  "All right, let it go at that.  I'll
never speak to you about him again, never."  She never did.
</p>

<p>
It was well that there was a painted room in the house, those
four weeks before she went back to college.  There was nothing
else bright about it.  Bob waited to intercept letters from "that
skunk" who, Mr. Fairbanks said, was to be for some time in
Rochester with his wife; but no letters seemed to come.
Martha appeared not to be humiliated by the fact that she had
practically declared her love for a man hopelessly, permanently
married.  In her secluded room she bided her time, a smile
on her lips, the sweetest dream in her eyes.  She was ignoring
her mother not only purposefully, but unconsciously.  She had
greater things than a mother's anxiety to think about.
</p>

<p>
Her coldness sickened Emily every minute of the day.  She
scarcely knew how to get through the hours, so burdened were
they with yearning over the silly girl.  Never had the garden
bloomed so hilariously before in August and September.
Never had it had such care before.  Emily watered her dahlias
sometimes till midnight, dreading a sleepless bed when she went
into the house.  She rose up early and watered them under
stars she had seldom seen setting.  Once out there, hoping,
praying, she had looked up and in the very early dawn seen
Martha sitting dreaming at her window.  And the sight of that
distant, alienated child took all the color from the dawn and
heaven.
</p>

<p>
Life indeed had assumed the color of dread and heart-sickness.
Johnnie had waited a few days, and then departed.
Emily was glad she had seized an occasion to say to him
secretly, hurriedly, "Johnnie, I'm very fond of you!"  He had
given her a surprised and precious look.  But he had not even
said he was leaving.  His mother said he had gone down to
have some coaching in philosophy&mdash;it was his last year in
college.  Eve never came to the house.  Emily met her occasionally
on the street, in the stores.  And once she said, passionately:
"Oh, I hate to run into you this way!  I'm ashamed to
look you in the face!"  And in her own house the atmosphere
was either very cold, when she and Martha were together, or
very sultry, when Bob was with them, so that she lived in
terror of some further deadly burst of thunder.
</p>

<p>
Martha announced one day that she was going to Chicago
for shopping.  She would naturally do that several times,
getting her clothes ready for the school year.
</p>

<p>
Emily said to her: "Before you go, Martha, you must
promise me one thing.  You must promise me you will NOT
see&mdash;at all&mdash;that man."
</p>

<p>
"You don't trust me any more?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Martha.  It's your judgment.  I don't trust your
judgment."
</p>

<p>
"No, I suppose not.  I see."
</p>

<p>
"Will you promise me that, Martha?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't think so.  I don't think I will."
</p>

<p>
"What am I to do now?" thought Emily.  "Shall I say that
she can't leave this house till she promises me that?"
</p>

<p>
Martha was looking at her hostilely, steadily.  "I'll tell you
what I'll do.  I'll think it over.  I'll tell you to-morrow what
I'll do," she said.
</p>

<p>
On the morrow, she said, "Mother, if it will do you any
good, I'll promise&mdash;what you want me to."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Martha!" Emily cried to her, "you <i>must</i> promise me
that, absolutely!  Martha, I just couldn't let you go away to
school again, unless you promise me that!"
</p>

<p>
"All right, I promise you.  If you can't trust my&mdash;judgment,
as you say"&mdash;she spoke sarcastically&mdash;"I suppose you
can&mdash;believe&mdash;what I say."
</p>

<p>
Bob's eyes dwelt resentfully upon his daughter, and loyally
on his distressed wife, all those painful last days before Martha
left for the East.
</p>

<p>
"I'll bet you lost twenty pounds this summer, Emily!" he
said, ruefully, when they were alone at length.
</p>

<p>
"Well, thank goodness for that!" she retorted, loyal to the
child.  "I wish I'd lost twenty more."  She knew he would
count grudgingly all the ounces she suffered.  Yet it was no
great thing to him if Martha had lost her very heart.
</p>

<h3>
<i>Chapter Six</i>
</h3>

<p>
They gathered their green tomatoes, to save them from
the frost.  Emily and Maggie, in the delicious kitchen, made
chilli sauces and the good kind of vegetarian mincemeat.  The
house was filled with the excellent odors of the ends of the
earth.  Java and Jamaica were stirred into Illinois, and sealed
away in sturdy bottles which took their places chronologically
in the cupboard next to the wild grape and the crab-apple
jelly below the spiced peaches.  The bottles had to be pushed
close against one another, now, to make room for them in
the crowded shelves.
</p>

<p>
But when Emily looked into the cupboard of her heart, it
was bare.
</p>

<p>
She had dug the gladiolas; she had cut the last of the
lavender statice, which she had sown in happier days to make
glamour in the painted room, and hung it head downward to
dry with the rosy strawflowers.  The frosts came and turned
the hard maples gaudy.  The old Fiske place seemed always to
lose its head completely in the fall.  There grew a barberry
hedge along the front walk, which Emily's father had planted
when he took down the white picket fence.  He had simply put
those little dry-looking shoots into the ground one rainy spring
morning years ago, never imagining what riot he was planting.
For years now, on every brilliant Sunday afternoon, while the
leaves were falling, townspeople had walked out to see that
hedge, to hear its rejoicings.  The knowing had taken cuttings
of it, to their disappointment, for even that offspring hedge
just across the road had never been able to achieve quite such
giddiness.  Some people said it was the soil that did it.  Others
maintained it was the way in which the water soaked down to
the river just there.  Such cherries of ripeness, such roses
and purple grapes and bleeding pomegranates of hues, such
plums and persimmons and exotic luminous loquats glowing
together, such oranges and oracles of color, no other hedge
could summon.  People got joy out of it according to their
moods and natures.  But Emily, for once, could take no
pleasure in it.
</p>

<p>
"Last year," she would say to herself, resentfully, "I enjoyed
just sitting at this window mending socks.  Anything made me
happy last year."  But now, when she sat down with her
sewing, she wasn't seeing what was before her&mdash;the hedge, or
anything else.  The fingers of one hand would be intertwined
tensely with the fingers of the other, and she would be sitting
as it were, screwed up tight against herself, seeing that face
bending down over Martha, that hateful, alienating face.  She
was seeing Martha in a gingham frock standing at that table,
saying in a voice like the angel of some heavenly annunciation,
"Richard Quin is getting a divorce."  "I'm a fool!" she would
say angrily to herself over and over, resolving not to worry.
When one day some child with bitter-sweet had reminded her
of a promise to Martha made early in June, she had got
Bob to drive her out to where the vine grew heavily on a
barbed wire fence.  She and Martha had been chattering just
there in July, as they drove along, and Martha had made her
promise to gather some of it for the painted room.  And that
afternoon, after she had arranged it in the red copper bowls,
she had lain down on a day bed and just cried and cried like a
silly girl, so that, in spite of her precautions, Bob had eyed
her at supper and laid another charge against Martha in his
memory.
</p>

<p>
Martha would not come home for Thanksgiving.  Emily had
never suggested it to her before.  They had agreed that it
wasn't worth while coming so far for so few days.  But this
year Emily had hoped that some way, if she came, they might
come to some understanding.  But Martha refused to come.
Her letters arrived as regularly as ever, as if she had
determined that in this disagreement she was to be found in the
wrong not at all.  She was going to do her duty to her mother,
however unsatisfactory that mother might be.  She wrote
regularly, therefore, such noncommittal and indifferent letters as
she might have written to her father had necessity arisen.  And
Emily counted the weeks wearily till she would have the child
with her again.  Surely the separation, if nothing else, would
bring her to her senses; and she tried not to worry.  Martha
had given her her word of honor that she would not see the
man again.  She had always been a truthful child; there was no
gainsaying that.
</p>

<p>
Then one day, shortly before the Christmas holiday, Emily
got a most disturbing letter from Eve.  She wrote loyally in a
very storm of perplexity.  She had promised Martha faithfully
that she would not write this to her mother, she began.  And
the more she thought about it, the more certain she was that
she must write it.  Martha scarcely spoke to her&mdash;she never
did if she could manage not to without being noticed.  Martha
had said two days ago to her that she was not going home for
Christmas.  And everybody was saying how bad Martha
looked.  She was sick; she had no color; and all the girls said
she was changed.  And Eve had to cry about it, because she
believed it was that horrid affair of last summer.  Martha had
never been the same since.  And if she wasn't going home for
Christmas, certainly some one ought to tell her mother how
bad she looked.  Eve begged Emily never to tell Martha she
had written&mdash;to deny it up and down, if Martha guessed.  But
she was just sick about Martha.  "After all, I'm older than
she is, and I have more sense," Eve wrote.  "And I can't help
feeling that it's our fault.  I would wish with all my heart we
had never gone to Illinois&mdash;only then I wouldn't have known
you."
</p>

<p>
And the next day Martha's letter had come, announcing her
intention of spending the vacation in New York.  Just New
York, if you please, no address given, no intimation of her
company.  "You know what will happen if I come home," she
wrote.  "I'll just quarrel with father and you'll be miserable.
It's better for me to stay away."
</p>

<p>
Martha had left this announcement, naturally, to the very
last minute.  But Eve's letter had prepared Emily.  She
telegraphed at once, knowing she had likely just time to reach
Martha before she left college, that she was to meet her in a
certain hotel in New York the next afternoon.  She said
nothing to Bob about Eve's letter.  Eve's anxiety and Martha's
impertinence between them had upset her completely.  Did
Martha imagine she was going to be allowed to announce her
departure for unknown places and companies in this
high-handed manner?  What was the child thinking of?  Was it
possible&mdash;that she might not get the telegram?  Was it possible
that if she did, she wouldn't obey?
</p>

<p>
Emily had chosen that hotel hastily.  She usually stayed
with cousins in New York.  But at Christmas time they might
be having a house full.  Besides, she couldn't endure the
thought that Martha might be indifferent to her before them.
</p>

<p>
So she moved about the room she had taken in the hotel.
She arranged the things she had unpacked, and rearranged
them.  She looked at the time, and she looked out of the
window to the crowded street very far below.  Martha was
already a little bit late.  Suppose she never came at all!
Suppose she hadn't come by dinner time, by bed time!  Emily
couldn't sit still.
</p>

<p>
And then she heard some one; she opened the door; Martha
was there, in her racoon coat, in a rosy little hat of many
colors, pulled down over a sallow face; Martha was in her
arms, and crying; in a second Martha, coat and all, was lying
on the bed, her face in her mother's lap, repenting with bitter
tears.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I've been so horrid to you, mammie!  I've been so
horrid to you!  I'm so sorry!"  She was hugging her, clinging
to her, imploring her pardon.
</p>

<p>
So Emily cried, too, for surprise and relief, and comforted
her, and urged her to stop crying.  This was better than
anything she had dared to hope for.  But she had known all the
time Martha would come to herself.  The child hadn't meant
anything, really.  She had always been such a good girl.  Emily
in a second could have forgotten every minute that had not
been satisfactory.  This was well worth having come to New
York for.
</p>

<p>
Martha wasn't succeeding in regaining her composure.
Emily attempted to take her coat off, but thought it better not
to bother her.  She just lay and cried.  And she had never
been a crying child.  Emily had seen to that.  All these tears,
all this passion of repentance, showed what a loving little heart
she had.  "How I have wronged the child!" Emily mused,
wiping her eyes.  "I thought she might not come at all!"  And
she caressed her, and waited patiently.  "Don't cry any more
now, Martha," she said.  "We'll forget all about it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wish I'd been a good girl!"  And having said that,
she wept on.
</p>

<p>
She cried too long.
</p>

<p>
Emily said, presently: "Your feet are making a mark on
the bedspread.  Get up.  Take off your coat."
</p>

<p>
"I'm cold, mammie."  She sat up, fumbled about, and kicked
off her low shoes, and lay down again, trying to cuddle her
feet up under her coat.
</p>

<p>
"Cold?"  The room had been so hot a moment ago that
Emily had the windows both opened.  She got up and went
and shut them.
</p>

<p>
"Where's your baggage?" she asked in a matter-of-fact
way, to stop the tears.
</p>

<p>
"I had it taken to my room."
</p>

<p>
"Your room?"
</p>

<p>
"I took a room for myself.  I didn't know you would have
two beds in here."
</p>

<p>
Emily was on the point of saying, "You might at least have
inquired."  But Martha went on:
</p>

<p>
"I'm so tired, mammie, I just had to have a room for myself.
I could sleep a week straight off."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Emily, doubtfully.  She turned on the light.
Martha hadn't even taken her little hat off.  It was crushed
down over an ear.  Her nose was red.  She looked like a wreck.
She didn't like her mother's scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
"Turn off that light," she pleaded.
</p>

<p>
Emily turned it off.
</p>

<p>
"Get up and wash your face," she said.
</p>

<p>
But Martha cried, "Oh, mammie, honestly, I never
meant&mdash;to hurt you!" and threw herself down, sobbing, her face buried
in her hands.
</p>

<p>
Emily remembered Eve's letter, and grew more pitiful.  "I
never would have thought this would prey on her mind so
much," she thought.  "How am I going to make Bob understand
this?  I wish he could hear her now."  It was very bad
for her to cry so deeply, however.
</p>

<p>
"Where is your room, Martha?  I want to see it.  Brace up."
</p>

<p>
"I'll show it to you&mdash;after a while."  She still was sobbing
aloud.  She seemed hysterical.
</p>

<p>
"Martha," said Emily, with some sternness, "stop that;
stop crying.  Get up.  You must get ready for dinner."
</p>

<p>
Martha sat up, huddled together on the edge of the bed.
She spoke very humbly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want any supper, mammie.  Honestly, I don't feel
like eating.  I'm tired.  I want to go to my room.  I'd rather
go to bed."
</p>

<p>
Emily stood looking at her wiping her eyes.  Poor Lamb!
Poor tender-hearted child!  She did look wretched.  Perhaps
she ought to be humored&mdash;just for this once.
</p>

<p>
"All right.  We'll have our supper up here.  We'll have a
regular spread."
</p>

<p>
"Honestly, I don't want anything to eat."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you've got to eat something.  That's all there is to it."
</p>

<p>
"All right, mammie."
</p>

<p>
They went together to look at Martha's room, two floors
above Emily's.  Martha was repressing sobs, now, like a
threatened child.  Emily asked about the college, to compose her.
Had she done good work this term?  But she said meekly she
didn't think she had done very well, not lately, anyway, when
she had been so sort of tired.  Emily was eager to question
her, but thought it better to wait.  She offered to help unpack
the suitcase, but Martha was jealous of it, as if it was filled
with Christmas presents.
</p>

<p>
Emily went back to her room, to wait for the supper she had
ordered.  She sang to herself.  "O come, all ye faithful," she
hummed, "joyful and triumphant."  She was infinitely relieved
and lifted up.  She had an impulse to telegraph Bob that
everything was right again.  No, but as soon as supper was over, she
would write him a long letter.  She would explain the child's
repentance, her sweet, humble coming back.  She was so happy
that, when Martha came in, she just naturally took her in her
arms and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
Martha had come in steady and composed, but wearing the
coat of a suit.  Emily said, naturally, "Why have you got that
on?"  Her remark upset Martha entirely.  She sobbed again.
Emily reproved herself and scolded Martha lightly.  Here was
their supper.  What a lot of dishes!  Oh, what a good
time they would have, cozily here, together.  She called
Martha's attention to the pink lamp-shade.  "Not bad," she
said, "for a hotel room."
</p>

<p>
But Martha sat like a punished child, not whimpering aloud,
but shaking from time to time with stifled sobs.  When Emily
had insisted, she had ordered coffee and an alligator-pear salad,
and it seemed to Emily that the salad was mentioned hurriedly,
as an afterthought, to propitiate a mother.  When the salad
was set before her, she wasn't eating it.  She said apologetically
that the oil wasn't quite fresh.  Emily had offered her some
chicken, and insisted on her taking some.  And so she did, and
swallowed it obediently.  And she asked for more coffee.  No
wonder she was thin, if this was the way she had been eating.
Emily was about to refuse her more coffee.  But, surely,
to-morrow, after a night's sleep, she would be herself again.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to stay in bed till noon to-morrow, mammie,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't we going home to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, not to-morrow!  Let's wait&mdash;a little while&mdash;till
I&mdash;feel rested," she begged.  So that was agreed.  And there
seemed nothing else to say.  For Martha sat looking at her
mother wistfully, wiping away tears that kept flowing.  And
Emily refrained from talking because she seemed to be
making matters worse.  They were perfectly silent while their
supper was being carried away.  And when the door shut
behind the waiter, Martha said&mdash;she had been standing looking
down out of the window, and she turned about towards Emily:
</p>

<p>
"Are the bulbs in the window, mammie?"
</p>

<p>
"What bulbs?  At home?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  The Poet's narcissi in the hall window."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  They're almost out&mdash;the first ones.  I've got a
surprise for you, Martie!"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"I've got three purple hyacinths almost ready to bloom,
for your room&mdash;in glasses, you know!"
</p>

<p>
Now did not that seem an innocent remark?  Yet Martha
began simply to boo-hoo.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to bed," she sobbed.
</p>

<p>
"I think you'd better."  Emily wouldn't be sarcastic, but
she spoke dryly.  She insisted on going up and helping her
get to bed.  She kissed her shortly, for fear of more bewailings,
and promised not to waken her in the morning.
</p>

<p>
"I'm nervous, because I can't sleep always," Martha apologized.
"I'd rather sleep than do anything else.  I'll never
forgive you if you wake me up in the morning.  I'll get up
and come down to you just as soon as I wake up.  Nobody
ever had a better mother than I've got!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, cut out the sobby stuff, Martie!" Emily exhorted her.
"Don't be crying yourself to sleep.  Have you got anything to
read, if you don't think you'll sleep?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes.  I don't need anything.  Nothing."
</p>

<p>
After twelve the next day Emily returned from a morning's
shopping.  The Christmas crowds had thrust her about.  They
had pushed her and jostled her and jammed her into corners.
But she was in a mood for it all.  She could take it
light-heartedly.  They couldn't take the song from her.  "O come,
all ye faithful!" she kept humming to herself.  Wasn't she
prepared for Christmas?  Wasn't she eager to kneel and
worship the Eternal Child!  It was almost as if Martha had been
born to her again.  She tipped the elevator boy exuberantly just
because she was so happy, as she went up to her room.
</p>

<p>
Martha wasn't there.  She couldn't be sleeping, surely, at
that hour.  She would go up to her room.  She stood close to
Martha's door.  She called her softly; she called her not quite
so softly, but carefully.  Martha was awake inside.  Martha
was coming to the door.
</p>

<p>
Martha had on her fur coat, and her rosy hat, ready to go
out.  She drew her mother in.  They kissed.  "She's been
crying again!" Emily thought.  "She looks ghastly!  She must
have cried all night."  Her eyes were dry, but ringed about
with sunken circles.  She spoke quietly.  She seemed to be
speaking from a great depth of&mdash;what?&mdash;not worry&mdash;a depth
of hopelessness, Emily thought, quickly.
</p>

<p>
"You been shopping, mammie?  Weren't the crowds terrible?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, terrible!  But I did want to get a few things before
we go home.  Are you feeling better?  Shall we go
to-morrow? if we can get reservations?"
</p>

<p>
Martha sat thinking.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I think we'd better go to-morrow, if you can get
them."
</p>

<p>
"You're ready to go for lunch?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; if you&mdash;&mdash;  Yes, I'm ready."
</p>

<p>
"Have you had breakfast?"
</p>

<p>
"I had enough."
</p>

<p>
"What did you have, Martha?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;didn't feel like much.  I had coffee and toast."
</p>

<p>
But when they sat in the darkest corner of a crowded, noisy
restaurant, she only pretended to be eating.  She scarcely
spoke, and when she did her voice was&mdash;strange, so that Emily
sat thoughtfully watching her.
</p>

<p>
"Can you go and get the reservations after we've finished?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I can.  Aren't you coming with me?"
</p>

<p>
"I want to go out for just a thing or two, mammie.  But
look here, can't you just&mdash;pay part of the tickets?  You don't
have to pay it all to-day, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean&mdash;if I don't feel well enough to go to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"This is no place to begin to catechise her," Emily thought,
"but I've got to find out what's the trouble with her, some way,
before long."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know whether they will reserve them that way or
not.  I'll ask, if you want me to."
</p>

<p>
"I think it would be&mdash;a good plan."
</p>

<p>
Martha was sitting with her back to the room, her elbow on
the table, and her head on her hand&mdash;not in a correct way,
nor a graceful way.  Emily looked at her.  After all, look
how other people sat&mdash;well-dressed people, but not nice-looking
people.  Horrid-looking girls, some of these were.  Who, she
wondered, were they?  If Martha preferred not to talk, there
was much for a small-town woman to be looking about at, in
the room: smart clothes, painted faces.  It was absolutely a
thrill to see a woman so shamelessly vicious-looking, with some
sort of green paint to make shadows under her eyes.  Emily's
unsophisticated glance was intent upon the person.  The waiter
was putting her parfait before her, when a bomb, thrown from
Martha's colorless lips, made her almost jump.
</p>

<p>
"Tell father&mdash;- I mean&mdash;he doesn't know how much I
appreciate him, mammie.  He's been a good father to me, always."
</p>

<p>
Goodness gracious me!  What in the world?  The child
must be out of her mind!
</p>

<p>
"Martha!" said Emily, sharply, "what is the matter with
you?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry I've always been so&mdash;horrid to him."
</p>

<p>
"Now look here, Martha, let that drop!  You mustn't be
morbid about this.  I'll explain everything to him for you, if
you want me to."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, do, mammie."
</p>

<p>
"I'll take that child to a doctor to-morrow!" Emily resolved.
</p>

<p>
They parted abruptly when they rose from the table.  Martha
went out to get her few things.  Emily went to the station for
her reservations, curiously.  And she dallied about.  They were
to have tea together at four-thirty.  It was Emily's suggestion.
Anything to get Martha to eat, she had thought.
</p>

<p>
She came back to the hotel carrying a large box of the most
tempting chocolates she could find, and candied fruits, which
Martha had been eager for.  She didn't like the hotel she had
chosen.  The lobby, the whole floor, was full of groups of men,
business men, perhaps, standing around importantly pretending
to be discussing affairs of moment, and covertly eying
every woman who entered.  Well, thank goodness, she was no
longer either young or conspicuous.  But how they must look
at Martha!  She went to the desk and asked for her key.
</p>

<p>
Now the sleek-haired young man standing there, instead of
handing it to her promptly, went and spoke to a more important
young man somewhat older.  This man heard what he said and
looked curiously at Emily, while the second one approached
her.
</p>

<p>
"Are you Mrs. Kenworthy?" he asked, suavely.
</p>

<p>
She said she was.
</p>

<p>
"Will you step this way, please?"
</p>

<p>
She hadn't time to ask why.  He had come out from behind
the counter-like desk and was showing her the way&mdash;a few
steps down a passage.
</p>

<p>
"Just here," he was saying.  "The manager wants to speak
to you."
</p>

<p>
And he threw open a door into a lighted office, and said,
"This is Mrs. Kenworthy," and went out, and closed the door
behind him.
</p>

<p>
Emily, wondering mildly, saw in a glance a sort of office;
a room in which, perhaps temporarily, a good deal of extra
furniture was crowded&mdash;several easy chairs pushed close
together, beyond a long bare oak table, with shaded desk lamps.
Three men were standing there, by the table, the shadow of the
lamp-shade hiding their faces.
</p>

<p>
"Are you Mrs. Kenworthy?" one of them asked her.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said.  She didn't like this.
</p>

<p>
"Has your daughter a dog?"
</p>

<p>
The man didn't seem facetious.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me!" Emily spoke coldly.
</p>

<p>
The man was looking at her keenly.
</p>

<p>
"I said, has your daughter here a dog?"  He made a gesture
and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Why, there was Martha, sunken down in the farther one of
those crowded armchairs&mdash;that was her coat and hat, at least;
her face was hidden.  Emily moved quickly towards her.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Madame, this young lady has been trying to buy poison
for her dog."
</p>

<p>
"There is some mistake about this."  Emily felt herself
begin to tremble.  "My daughter hasn't a dog."
</p>

<p>
"We didn't think she had."
</p>

<p>
"What happened, Martha?"  Emily's hand was on her
shoulder, but Martha never lifted her head.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;do you mean?" Emily faltered.  They looked so
ominous&mdash;so excited.  Nobody spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, will you tell me what you mean?" Emily cried out.
Something frightful was here.
</p>

<p>
"Madame, we have to protect ourselves.  We can't have
some one&mdash;taking her own life&mdash;in our rooms every month in
the year.  This girl&mdash;we kept her here&mdash;we didn't think she
had a dog.  She was trying to buy poison, madame!"
</p>

<p>
"You're mistaken!  Martha, what were you doing?"  She
tried to get her to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Madame, we have had to offer a reward&mdash;to any employee
who prevents&mdash;such a thing.  This bell-boy"&mdash;he was actually
indicating a negro standing near him&mdash;"just happened to be in
a drug store, and saw your daughter refused&mdash;this poison.  He
recognized her; he followed her into another drug store.
Who'd sell a girl with that face&mdash;anything?  He called this
policeman."
</p>

<p>
"I think you're all mistaken.  She hasn't been well.  I'll take
her up and put her to bed," Emily babbled.  She was kneeling
on the floor by Martha, shaking Martha's arm, and urging
her to explain.
</p>

<p>
"No, madame, not to the ninth floor, not a girl in that
condition.  We have to defend ourselves.  We'll let you talk to
her here."  He started towards the door.  "Just ring here, I'll
come back for you."
</p>

<p>
"Martha!  Baby!  What is this?  What were you doing?
What happened after I left you?  Tell me!  Tell me, Martha!
Why didn't you explain to those men?"
</p>

<p>
When Emily tried to pull her hands away from her face,
Martha stirred and jerked back, and buried it in her coat sleeve.
Her little thin voice came out, muffled, gasping:
</p>

<p>
"I've got to die."
</p>

<p>
Could it be that the child still loved that man so?  What
else could it be?
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't say such things, Martie!  Martha, why didn't
you say to them you weren't trying to buy&mdash;anything.  Were
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes.  I've got to die."
</p>

<p>
Emily's hand was stroking her arms tenderly.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Martha simply cried out, "Oh, can't you understand?"
</p>

<p>
"I may be stupid.  I don't know what this means!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll say it, then.  I'll say it to you!"
</p>

<p>
Finally she did say it.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to have a baby.  I can't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The arm that was around Martha fell away.  The hand that
was stroking her ceased its motion.  Emily knelt there, against
the coat, against the chair; she went on kneeling there, and
moments passed.
</p>

<p>
Martha was stirring herself.  She was trying to rise.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go," she moaned.
</p>

<p>
Emily's arms tightened around her knees.  She held her fast.
</p>

<p>
"Where you going?"
</p>

<p>
"I've got to die, some way."
</p>

<p>
"Martha, you don't know what you're saying.  It isn't true.
You're not going to have&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It is true.  Let me go."
</p>

<p>
"I won't let you go.  You can't die.  I'm saving
you."  Emily didn't really know what she was saying.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm going with you everywhere.  I'm going to see you
through it, then.  I won't let them hurt you."
</p>

<p>
Martha began sobbing.  "Won't you let me go?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't."
</p>

<p>
"Will you stay with me?"
</p>

<p>
"You are my child."  Martha's sobs reassured her.  "Don't
ever say that&mdash;promise me not to think of&mdash;dying.  Martha,
promise me.  I'll take care of you, Martha, if you promise."
</p>

<p>
"How can I live?"
</p>

<p>
"How can I let you&mdash;die?  Oh, how awful of you, to think of
such things.  Is this why you came to New York?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I ought to, mammie.  You don't want me&mdash;living
now.  Dad won't."
</p>

<p>
Emily rose up.  She was recovering from the shock&mdash;the
stunning.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take care of you.  Don't worry.  We must go upstairs.
We must talk it over.  I don't know."
</p>

<p>
She led the child towards the door.  She opened it.  The
policeman stood there, guarding it.  He would not let them
out.  "I'll call the manager," she said.
</p>

<p>
But Martha had recoiled, moaning: "Don't let that man
touch me!  That man caught hold of my arm, mother!"
</p>

<p>
And the moment the manager entered, Emily spoke to him
composedly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm taking this child to my room.  She isn't well.  I must
put her to bed."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, madame; you can't take her to the ninth floor&mdash;not
in that condition."
</p>

<p>
How could he see her condition, when she was hidden behind
her mother?  Emily was annoyed.  She controlled her voice.
</p>

<p>
"Can we have another room at once, then, lower down?"
</p>

<p>
"No, madame; we have no empty room."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?  Can't we have a room?"
</p>

<p>
"No, madame; we're full."
</p>

<p>
"You mean you want us to leave?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you'll have to."
</p>

<p>
Emily couldn't believe him.
</p>

<p>
"You mean you don't want us to stay here?"
</p>

<p>
"It comes to that.  We've had unfortunate things&mdash;too many
of them&mdash;lately.  Leave the young lady here.  I'll take charge
of her while you pack your things.  Or shall I have them
brought down for you?"
</p>

<p>
She went out of the door, into Martha's shame, into the
lobby where all eyes seemed to be upon her, into the elevator.
The negro youth seemed to be pointing her out, a disreputable
woman being turned out of the hotel.  She got her things
together; she went to Martha's room; she sent their luggage
down; she went down and paid her bill at the desk window.
Years afterwards she could feel those men looking at her
curiously.  She went to the room where Martha sat a prisoner.
The manager was solicitous.  He told the boy to have her
things put in a taxi at the less conspicuous entry.  She took
Martha out, therefrom, down a quiet hall.
</p>

<p>
"Where to?" asked the chauffeur.
</p>

<p>
"To the Pennsylvania Station," she said.
</p>

<p>
It was almost dark, and very cold, and the taxi seemed not
to move at all through the crowds.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do with me now?" Martha moaned.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Emily.
</p>

<p>
At the station she put Martha down where she could watch
her from a telephone booth.  She daren't turn towards the
mouthpiece to speak for more than a second.  Suppose Martha
should disappear.  She 'phoned one hotel after another.  None
of them had a room on the second floor.  A horror was in her
mind&mdash;a girl falling, falling, to destruction.  By the time
she had heard her fourth refusal she felt faint.  She went back
out to the waiting room.  Everyone was going home.  Everyone
was loaded down with Christmas gayety.  She sat there.
And Martha sat there.  They had no place to go.  It was
Christmas time, but there was no room for them in any inn,
because of a baby.
</p>

<p>
Some place to hide; some place to plan and think.  She
remembered a country hotel on Long Island.  Would it be
open at this season?  But no, it was on the Sound.  She was
afraid of water and that desperate girl.  After a little she
thought of the right place.  There was a little hotel in a small
New Jersey town.  Years ago she and her aunt had gone there,
quite unannounced, for a night, to visit an old cemetery in the
neighborhood.  They could go there.
</p>

<p>
Jostled and pushed about in the jam of the local train, Emily
got back some of her presence of mind.  She got out, with
Martha, at the station, and stood looking about.  She didn't
remember the place at all.  Cars were waiting for most of those
who arrived.  She asked a newsboy about the hotels.  He would
carry her things up and show her the way.
</p>

<p>
They turned into the quiet little main street.  Yellow lights
from the shops were shining out across the snow.  People were
hurrying along in one direction.  The boy was talkative.  It
was only a little way to the hotel.  When they drew near it,
he said: "Look!  Look at the Christmas tree!"
</p>

<p>
A little way farther down the street, across from the hotel,
a crowd was gathered around an old lighted-up tree just near
the sidewalk, in what seemed to be the front yard of a dwelling
house.
</p>

<p>
"It's a real tree.  It's not a cut-down one!" he informed
them.  "They sing there."
</p>

<p>
"I always remembered what a quiet place you had here,"
Emily said to the clerk.  "I've always been wanting to get
back."  She wanted to make their arrival&mdash;on Christmas
Eve&mdash;a natural thing.  Would the man be suspicious?
</p>

<p>
But no.  He took them in; they had a roof over them again,
a room, comfortless enough, but a room, and one double bed,
on which Martha had thrown herself down.  They must have
supper in their room to-night.  Emily had begged something,
anything hot.  She pulled the curtains down and opened the
bags, and started to get Martha to bed.
</p>

<p>
When the maid came with the supper tray, outside there,
under the great glimmering tree, the crowd was singing praise
to God become Baby through a woman's body; and inside
Emily was looking at Martha's little breast, and her sobbing
white abdomen, and a girl's flesh seemed to have become hell.
</p>

<p>
Emily had to probe her ignominy that night, for the thought
kept coming to her, even after what she had seen, that Martha
couldn't know what she was talking about.  She had to ask
her&mdash;terrible things; there was no help for that.  She had to
realize that her daughter had lied to her directly, thoughtfully,
and cunningly.  This affair had begun in the summer, before
Martha had promised her never to see that man again.  She
had promised not to see him, knowing when they were to meet
next, in Chicago.  "I was so sure, mammie!" she sobbed.  "I
knew it would be all right when you knew him!  I just loved
him so!"  Martha had gone back to college to lie cunningly
there, to get permission to spend every week-end in New York,
to study dancing, which her mother was so keen to have her
take up, she had averred.  Well, she had been punished,
punished by having to look in the terrible face of Death.  Suppose
that colored bell-boy hadn't been in the drug store,
there&mdash;&mdash;  Emily's arms tightened about her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what are you going to do with me now?"  Well might
little Martha Kenworthy ask that.  There seemed no good
reason why she shouldn't go on crying indefinitely, forever.
But Emily, drawing her close against her in bed, tucking the
covers about her, trying to get her warm, hoped doggedly to
find comfort for her, to get her quiet.  There were worse
things than having a baby, she told her once, crooning over her.
</p>

<p>
And Martha said, "What?"  And then added, "Oh, you
mean being discarded!"
</p>

<p>
Discarded?  Martha Kenworthy discarded?
</p>

<p>
"She is beyond me in knowledge," Emily thought.  "I've
never known bitterness."
</p>

<p>
She had to ask her, "Does that man know about this?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;told him.  He said&mdash;&mdash;"  She couldn't say it for
weeping.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind.  It doesn't matter."
</p>

<p>
But after a while Martha did say it:
</p>

<p>
"He said I'd got him into a dirty mess."
</p>

<p>
Emily reproached herself.  She wouldn't ask, even, where
he was now, where his wife was, whether he was divorced.
She wouldn't have Martha marry that man now, if he was able
to marry her a hundred times over.
</p>

<p>
"Martha, you mustn't cry this way.  You mustn't.  You'll
make yourself sick."
</p>

<p>
"No, it won't; it can't.  Nothing makes me sick enough.
I've tried everything."
</p>

<p>
"What?  What have you tried?"
</p>

<p>
And Martha, lying cuddled against her there, recounted
horrors.  "At school," she sobbed, once resentfully, "there isn't
any privacy.  Those girls just come singing and laughing right
into your room.  I tried things week-ends, when I was in the
city."
</p>

<p>
"Alone?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mammie.  I thought I'd killed myself once&mdash;two weeks
ago.  When I tried to get up I fainted.  I fell on the floor, and
I thought I was dying; and I couldn't ring for anybody&mdash;they
might find out."
</p>

<p>
Emily had to hear all that&mdash;to imagine it.
</p>

<p>
She said, after a while, "I'm going to take you to a doctor
to-morrow&mdash;-day after to-morrow.  The best one I can find."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go to Mexico; I'll hide somewhere; I'll go to South
America!"
</p>

<p>
"We could never be sure we had hidden ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"No, I know it.  Oh, I've thought of everything.  In books
they do it; in books no one ever finds out.  There's 'The Old
Maid.'  We could do it."
</p>

<p>
"We'd always be afraid.  We'd never have any peace of
mind again."
</p>

<p>
"You don't need to go with me.  I can go."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to see you through this.  I think home would
be the best place, Martha."
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't go home!  Never, mother.  Oh, imagine what
dad would say to me!"
</p>

<p>
Emily had thought of that.  She had decided.  "That's my
house!" she had said as they came out on the train.  "I'll take
my child home to it.  If Bob wants to leave, he can leave."
</p>

<p>
"You don't appreciate your father.  If we should go home,&mdash;this
way&mdash;to him, he would stand by us.  There's no use
saying he wouldn't."
</p>

<p>
"He would stand by you, mother.  I'll say that much for
him.  He wouldn't leave you when you're in trouble.  He's not
like&mdash;&mdash;  But he would be always hating me; if he didn't scold
me, he would be wanting to.  I couldn't stand that.  I won't
go home.  I won't let you tell him this.  I'd rather&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't say that!" Emily moaned.
</p>

<p>
"We can go abroad.  We could go to Sweden, or the Philippines."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, all right.  Now stop crying, Martha.  Try to go to
sleep.  I'll make arrangements.  I'll fix it all up for you."
</p>

<p>
The girl dozed at length, moaning.  The clock struck, and
the hours passed, and Emily lay there, open-eyed, fleeing in
vain terror from one corner of her consciousness to the other,
whacked and battered through the soul by fact after brutal
fact.  She was in no condition to think clearly.  It was her
habit of mind to blame herself for a great deal that was
never her fault, perhaps because all her tender years she had
had the sense of her aunt's disapproving eyes upon her.  And
now she shouldered all the blame of this tragedy.  This child
was what she had made her; she had spoiled her indeed.  She
had only wanted her to be happy, and where was happiness
now?  Her child, the work of her hands, the fruit of her body
and soul, had lowered herself to deliberate lying.  Yes, and
even that Emily Kenworthy could have pardoned if the child
had lied for a worthy man.  She had been found lacking the
essential womanly instincts of self-preservation&mdash;of child
preservation.  She hadn't known how to make herself
cherished.  She had failed fundamentally.  "What was it I
neglected?" Emily moaned.  "What didn't I teach her?  Bob
always said I spoiled her.  Bob knew.  I have failed.  I have
failed more than she has.  I thought only about her being
happy.  What am I going to do for her now?"
</p>

<p>
After a long while&mdash;it was towards morning, though Emily
had no thought of time&mdash;Martha rose with a start.  She began
scrambling hastily out of bed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sick!" she murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Lie down!  Wait!  I'll get you something!"
</p>

<p>
"A towel!  Hand me a towel!"
</p>

<p>
Emily jumped up and felt for the light.  The room was
bitterly cold.  She looked about for something to serve
Martha's need.  She searched hastily for her dressing gown.
</p>

<p>
"Get back into bed," she commanded.  "Cover up!"  She
sat down on the bed beside her, shivering violently, trying to
help her.  For Martha was leaning out over the side of the bed,
retching, choking, trying to stifle the sound of her misery by
covering her face with the towel.  Paroxysm after paroxysm
of nausea followed.  Between them Martha lay back in bed,
shivering, blue-lipped, sweat on her forehead, tears in her eyes,
harrowing to behold.
</p>

<p>
"Try to lie still, Martha!  Lie flat on your back!"
</p>

<p>
"Can't.  Oh&mdash;&mdash;"  And on went the sickening sounds.
</p>

<p>
She was so blue, so frightening to look at, that Emily
started to go to the door.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" Martha cried.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to wake somebody up!  I'm going to get some
hot water&mdash;a hot-water bag for you."
</p>

<p>
But the girl was in terror, and cried out:
</p>

<p>
"I never have anything, mammie.  Don't!  They might
guess!  I'll be all right, mammie.  Come into bed with me;
that'll warm me up!"
</p>

<p>
So Emily made the room as decent as she could.
</p>

<p>
"Hide that, <i>hide</i> it!  I'll manage in the morning.  I don't
want anybody to suspect anything!"
</p>

<p>
Emily got into bed, sickened, and gathered the child to her.
She was passionate with hate.  A man, any man, who inflicted
one such hour on a girl&mdash;&mdash;"I could just kill that man!"
she was raging.  If a decent boy had given her child a box of
sickening chocolates, by accident, what a fuss there would have
been!  How he would have had to grovel!  And as she raged
in her mind, she heard Martha imploring comfort.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how long is this going to go on, mammie?"
</p>

<p>
"How long has it gone on?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, weeks!  From the first!  Oh, I was so afraid they
would hear, at school!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a memory flashed over Emily.  She felt the hours
she had suffered such discomfort&mdash;for the sake of this undone
child.  She and Bob had been living in their wretched little
rooms over the drug store on Main Street.  And she could see
Bob standing there, in his nightshirt, a lamp in his hand,
solicitous and dumfounded, because she lay sick and laughing,
tears in her eyes, and singing on her lips, shaken with delight
over the significance of her symptoms.  She had been beside
herself with happiness at the prospect of a baby.  Certainly
never before in her life, and seldom since, had she known such
heavenly satisfaction as during those weeks.  The very sensation
of that dear expectancy came back to her.
</p>

<p>
And Martha, in her arms, moaned wearily.
</p>

<p>
Then Emily turned away from her, towards the wall, and,
covering herself up to the eyes, began an utterly sick and bitter
weeping.  At every gasp some new phase of her misery came
to contrast its horror with the former loveliness.  The years
came all tumbling down in great crushing masses upon her,
and the beauty of that baby, her little parties, her sweet little
coats.  It was Christmas morning, she remembered, and she
could see the little thing in her footed sleeping suit standing
twinkling in ecstasy about a stocking from which a red-headed
doll peeped out.&mdash;Dolls, what lots of dolls, to teach her
motherhood&mdash;and Jim playing with her!  It was for this child's sake
that her mother had refrained from all the life she might have
had with her dear Jim.  And now&mdash;&mdash;  This was the end of
it all.  "If I had left her&mdash;deserted her&mdash;gone with him, could
she have been worse off than she is now?" Emily asked; and
she went on weeping.  She saw the painted room from which
the child had shut herself out.  She had made herself a dark
house of regret now, this house-loving girl who had destroyed
herself.  Where should they go now?  "To whom can I go
for help?" Emily cried.  If Jim were living, if she could go
to New York and tell Jim all this, so he could help her&mdash;&mdash;  There
was no one living to whom she could turn.  "I'll take
her to Wilton," she moaned; "he'll know what to do!"  Home
was impossible.  Could she take her lovely daughter there&mdash;this
child whom she had watched them admire?  That woman
would find them there, that jealous, married, wild woman, who
had open, unquestioned cause now for scandals and fury.  She
heard Martha speaking to her, imploring her, crying with her,
but she paid no heed to her.  The heat in the steam pipes began
pounding.  Daylight came into the room.  Martha got up to
conceal what signs she might find of her sickness.  Martha
showed strange skill in furtiveness now.  She seemed to have
acquired habits of cunning.  Presently she was standing there,
lying glibly to the wondering chambermaid.  Her mother was
ill; her mother had had news of bereavement.  She must have
some breakfast brought up.
</p>

<p>
Emily had been forty-three years old when she had left
home last.  But after Christmas Day, it was months before
she thought of herself as anything but an old woman.  It
was not so much a day, the twenty-fifth of December,
as an epoch&mdash;a desert of disappointment from which she was
never likely to recover fully.  She got up and dressed that
morning, scarcely knowing what she did.  She sat down in
desperation and just looked at Martha.  She rallied after a
while, enough to suggest that they go out together for a walk.
But Martha refused.  There were lots of girls in her college
who lived in New Jersey.  She might meet somebody who
would ask what in the world she was doing in that little hotel
upon such an occasion.  She lay down, and Emily covered her
warmly.
</p>

<p>
She sat watching her sleep.  The afternoon faded away.
The darkness came, and they went to bed.  There they lay.
Martha slept till the evil hour of morning came, and passed
distressfully.
</p>

<p>
They got up, and Emily began to put her things into her
bag.  As she moved about, peace came to her some way.  It
was as if she realized at length that she was sentenced to death
and there was no escape possible.  She must die quietly.
Afterwards, she used to marvel over that strange consciousness
that came to her, that she could go through this horror, and
any other that might be coming to her, without frenzy, without
any outcry.  She knew that whichever hideous alternative she
had to go through, as long as Martha was saved alive to her,
she was able some way, quietly, to bear it.  She had never
experienced before such an exalted feeling of strength.  Even
Martha felt it.  She grew quieter.  She listened without a
murmur to her mother's plans, because Emily's voice was smooth
again.
</p>

<p>
She had decided that as soon as they got to New York she
would 'phone from the station to the head nurse of a hospital
to which she had once gone to see a friend.  She remembered
vividly the assured and adequate manner in which those nurses
had moved about.  She was loath to trouble them.  She would
say that she was a stranger in the city, without friends,
suddenly in need of a gynecologist.  She wanted a woman, and
the very best one.  Would the nurse recommend a perfectly
reliable one?
</p>

<p>
There was no hitch in the plan.  The nurse recommended
three, for she thought it likely that some of them might be away
for the holidays.  Emily was able to get an appointment with
the first one, but only late in the afternoon, after the other
patients had been seen.  She turned calmly from that 'phone,
and took Martha to the Brevoort Hotel.  She got a room on
the third floor.  She wouldn't have been afraid then of any
height.  It was no wonder that Martha had to exclaim, as
soon as the door was shut behind the porter with their luggage:
</p>

<p>
"How could you do it, mammie?"
</p>

<p>
"Let's not talk about it," she answered.
</p>

<p>
There was an hour to wait for lunch.  Only once did she
have that feeling of panic.  Her strength almost failed her
when she picked up the morning paper defensively and saw
the advertisements of "white sales."  Baby clothes were
illustrated there.  She threw the paper hastily down.  She mustn't
think of such a child in her house, playing in her willow tree.
She would hate that child; she wanted Martha to hate it.  Yet
they would have to make some sort of hateful preparations for
it.
</p>

<p>
After a while they rose and went down into the restaurant,
and found a place among untrapped, unmaddened men and
women, who didn't look as if they felt their lives reeling
through destruction.  Mother and daughter said but little.  If
anyone near had looked at them attentively, he would have
thought, probably, of two women who looked rather bored with
life and in need of diversion.
</p>

<p>
When the coffee came, Martha, who had chosen to sit with
her back to the room, was leaning on the table, her hand over
her eyes.  She had been looking in grim dejection at her
mother's hands.  She stirred, and said, nervously:
</p>

<p>
"Nobody would ever suspect you of anything, mother."
</p>

<p>
"Let's not talk about it," Emily almost whispered.
</p>

<p>
"I mean&mdash;I mean&mdash;I don't suppose you will have to take
your gloves off, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean&mdash;in the doctor's office."  She looked around her
slyly to see if she might be overheard.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't suppose so."  Emily thought best not to
question her.
</p>

<p>
But Martha persisted.
</p>

<p>
"Mammie, no one could suspect you of anything!  Lend me
your ring&mdash;your wedding ring."  Her voice died away.
</p>

<p>
Emily's voice never faltered.  "All right, if you want it."  She
spoke as if she had been asked for a nickel for the
telephone.  She put her hands down under the table and tugged
away at the ring.  Her fingers were larger now than they had
been the day Bob put the ring on, in the City Hall in Chicago,
in that room where, she still remembered, the spittoons sat in
rows.  She hadn't taken that ring off for years.  She was
handing it over now, with another one&mdash;a diamond one&mdash;which
Bob had given her two years ago, at Christmas time,
to her deserted daughter.  Bob seemed, just then, not so bad
a husband, after all.  Martha reached over for the rings, closed
her fingers about them, and put them furtively away in her
purse.
</p>

<p>
After an interminable afternoon the two of them, with their
story ready, came into the doctor's waiting room&mdash;a large
office which served the patients of several doctors; it was so
full that people were standing.  Yet as soon as the Kenworthys
entered, a woman older than her mother, after one glance at
Martha, rose hastily to offer her a place to sit down.  The
women made a place for Emily, crowding together.  Emily
didn't even wonder how many, like herself, were dreading a
death sentence&mdash;a sentence of life.  She sat there, in the
unspeakable intensity of consciousness of her wound, realizing
nothing of the room but the fact that Martha was sitting
huddled down in the next sofa, her hat pulled down to hide her
shrunken face.  Her lips only could be seen, from where her
mother sat, but they were not trembling.  And they sat there,
hour after hour, year after year; they had to sit waiting till
almost every one had been called in through one or another of
those doors.
</p>

<p>
The day was over, the night was on them.  It was half past
six when Emily finally took Martha into the room before the
judge.  They sat down before her in the full light.  She sat
behind that little desperately business-like desk, her face half
hidden by the lamp-shade.  She looked from one to the other
of them with shrewd, cynical, prosaic eyes.  Emily, as the words
came out of her mouth, knew every one of them was being
weighed.  She was being cross-questioned.  What made her
think her daughter wasn't strong enough to have a child?  What
made Emily suppose she was a delicate young woman?  The
whole slender history of Martha Kenworthy's child illnesses
was brought forth and examined.  The doctor's very questions
seemed to pronounce her a most rugged person.  Emily hadn't
thought to prepare any lying account of previous illnesses.  She
hadn't been skilled enough in deceit for that.
</p>

<p>
The woman got up and turned on pitiless lights.  She made
preparations; she gave Martha directions, shortly.  Emily sat
there.  She heard her heart pounding.
</p>

<p>
Once Martha moaned, lying on that white table.
</p>

<p>
"Don't do that.  Don't make that noise."
</p>

<p>
"You hurt me," Martha apologized.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," answered the doctor.  She went poking on.
Her manner was not ingratiating.  If she scented any tragedy
before her, she had no sympathy&mdash;no one ever need to cry
to that woman for help, Emily realized.
</p>

<p>
The doctor had finished.  She turned away to a basin and
stood washing her hands.  She reached for an immaculate
towel, and with it in her hands she turned about and stood
looking at her patient.  Martha was sitting up on that hospital-like
table.  The doctor went on drying her hands.  Finger after
finger she dried, one at a time, studying Martha mercilessly.
By the time she had finished that fourth finger, Emily could
stand the suspense no longer.  She managed to ask with only
ordinary concern:
</p>

<p>
"What do you find?"
</p>

<p>
The doctor kept her eyes steadily on Martha as she
answered:
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of fact, though you get your mother to do all
the talking, the truth is that you are scared out of your wits
at the mere thought of a baby.  Don't look at your mother;
answer me yourself!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Martha murmured, faintly.  "I didn't&mdash;I don't
want&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The doctor spoke grimly: "Well, don't worry.  You're
not going to have one."
</p>

<p>
She was still drying those hands.
</p>

<p>
Emily and Martha babbled together almost incoherently.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"You're not pregnant at all.  There's not a sign of pregnancy."
</p>

<p>
And as neither of the women moved, she added:
</p>

<p>
"Get down and dress."
</p>

<p>
Emily gasped, at length: "How can this be?  How&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The doctor spoke more kindly as soon as she turned to
Emily to answer: "It's hysteria.  It's nothing but hysteria."
</p>

<p>
"But those symptoms&mdash;those&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Emily was incredulous.
</p>

<p>
"I've had three cases of this this week.  They distrust their
precautions and get panicky.  They lose their heads."
</p>

<p>
"I never heard of such a thing in my life," Emily babbled.
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose <i>you</i> have!"  The doctor spoke tartly.
"When you had this child, women had nerve enough to carry
them through!"  She turned and looked almost scornfully at
Martha.
</p>

<p>
Martha had sat down abruptly on a chair.  Emily helped
her into her coat.  The doctor had been explaining to Emily:
the girl ought to be put to bed early for a while, well fed,
allowed no dances, no theaters, and kept much out-of-doors.  And
when Martha had sat down abruptly, after putting her coat
on, she said:
</p>

<p>
"If you feel faint, you'd better get out into the air."  And
she dismissed them from her presence.
</p>

<p>
Falling, being hurled down, those sensations had been bad
enough&mdash;but the shock of this crashing landing!  Those two
women went out of that office, down the elevator, out on to the
street so dazed that their minds seemed blank, so "taken aback"
they were, so strongly jerked back from the edge of destruction.
Martha, standing pressed close against her mother, one arm
around her, staring into her face, stood stuttering there in the
winter darkness, on the curb.
</p>

<p>
"D-d-d-do you believe it, mammie?"  She began laughing
and crying.  "Mammie! mammie!" she kept stuttering.  "Do
you believe it?"
</p>

<p>
In the taxi they found, Martha gave way to hysterics.  She
laughed and she sobbed crazily.  "Oh, mammie, if she could be
right!  Can she be right?  Am I all right?  She don't know
what she's talking about.  Oh, tell me, can it be true?"  She
was shaking Emily, trying to shake assurance out of her.  "Tell
me if it can be true, mammie!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Martha&mdash;a doctor&mdash;must know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No!  She doesn't understand!  How could it not be?
Mammie, tell me.  Oh, suppose it's true; I can live!  Mammie,
I can see you don't believe her!  We can go home now.  You
won't tell dad!  Oh, I will be good to you.  Didn't they say
she was a good doctor?  Mammie, what did that nurse say about
her?  But I did try every day to think it wasn't true.  And
it was.  Why was I so sick every morning?  Maybe I've only
got a cancer, mammie!"  Crying out a phrase like that, the
child was in such a madness of hope.  "Oh, suppose she's
right!"
</p>

<p>
"Martha, I feel like giving you the awfulest spanking
anybody ever got!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh <i>yes</i>!  Oh, I don't mind.  Mammie, imagine if it isn't
true; if I'm saved.  Here, here's your rings; I don't need
rings!"
</p>

<p>
When they drew up in front of the hotel, Emily forced her
to be quiet.  But Martha, in their room, threw off her coat and
her hat and all restraint in a great gesture.  She was lit up,
she was drunk with hope.  She walked around the room babbling,
her face ghastly pale and bright, stopping to hug her
mother, stretching out her arms, stretching them above her
towards the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose it's <i>true</i>!  Suppose it's all right!  Suppose I'm
safe!  I can <i>live</i> now.  No operation, mammie!  That woman
must have been fifty!  She must know what she's talking about.
Didn't you think she looked like a good doctor?  She must
have examined thousands of women.  I'm free; I'm safe!"  She
stopped and looked at herself in the mirror.  "Oh, look at
me!" she cried.  "<i>That's</i> how I feel."  And Emily, who had
sunk down on to the bed in her bewilderment, watching Martha,
suddenly began to cry.  That superhuman strength seemed to
have abandoned her.  For the girl had looked for a moment
intently at her reflection, and then turned, half crazy with joy,
to her suitcase.  She had snatched out her toilet things, she
was powdering her nose, she was rubbing something on her
white cheeks, herself again.  "Oh, I can <i>live</i> now!  Live!
Live!"  And she turned away from the glass and ran to Emily&mdash;she
had heard her sniffling&mdash;and began consoling kisses and
penitential hugs and tears.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go and get something to eat!" she said at length.  She
got up and washed away signs of tears.  She brushed her hair,
she powdered her nose, she got out a smarter pair of shoes.
"Let's walk and walk," she said.  "I could walk all night."  Out
on the street there, Emily felt Martha's strong arm
impelling her along by the passion of her relief.  She walked with
her head held high, she walked fiercely, like an arrow sure of its
target.  When they stopped at a crossing, her feet could not
stop their triumph.  Emily could feel her dancing.  She kept
babbling, singing, running on.  Emily said at length: "I can't
go any farther.  I'm too tired."  And then in a minute or two
they were turning into an opportune restaurant.
</p>

<p>
It was a large, uncarpeted room, with two rows of white-tiled
tables on either side of a central aisle.  Martha walked
down that aisle ahead of her mother.  Her head was held that
tense way, her eyes were shining positively black against her
white face, her air was wild.  People looked and started and
continued staring at her as if they had seen a pretty young
lunatic at large, or an aggressive and beautiful girl-ghost.  And
Martha, not thinking of them, walked straight to the farthest
table and would have sat down facing the crowd, if Emily had
not chosen that seat for herself.  Emily was conscious of the
sensation their entrance had made.  She was wondering how
Martha's excited pallor had triumphed over all the color she
had applied, for certainly she had stood dabbing rouge
on&mdash;before her mirror.  Martha grabbed the menu.  She had been
talking of turkey, of lobster.  She was hungry enough to eat
anything.  She ordered a large steak for two, with mushrooms.
She ordered asparagus and fried potatoes, and bread&mdash;a plateful
of brown bread.  She ordered coffee.  She would order
a lobster later, she told the waiter.  When he had gone, she
began whispering to Emily:
</p>

<p>
"Mammie, did you get our reservations?  Oh, I thought I
would be going home in a&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't!" murmured Emily.
</p>

<p>
"Can we go and change them on our way home?  Let's go on
the eleven o'clock.  But no, we must go to another doctor
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Emily tried to calm her.  It was herself the child was
enjoying now, as if her years of enjoying her thoughts had been
preparing her for this climax.  She looked as if she might burst
into flame.  She did burst forth when dinner was being set
before her.  The waiter was arranging her great feast, when she
cried out, suddenly unable to smother the joy of some thought.
She cried out, with a gesture of her hands below the table,
"Oh, my God!" so that the waiter fairly jumped.  People about
were watching them.  They smiled unanimously.  Martha didn't
seem even to know she was in a restaurant.
</p>

<p>
The next morning Martha said she hadn't slept well, but
Emily had watched her sleeping through the early morning,
and when she commented on the significance of that fact, Martha
was elated again above her weariness by happiness.  She went
for a walk in the morning alone.  Emily felt too exhausted to
go with her.  She ate more heartily than she had been able to
eat the evening before.  That great steak and those mushrooms
she had not been able to give any real attention to.  She
appealed to her mother every few minutes to tell her the truth
about the doctor's verdict, to comfort her about the probable
outcome of their visit to the next doctor.  She walked about
excitedly.
</p>

<p>
Late that afternoon the second doctor pronounced her free.
</p>

<p>
They came back to their hotel almost without a word.  In
their room they sat down; they looked at each other dazed;
they each felt the other trying to fathom the experience through
which they had gone.  "How <i>could</i> that have happened?"
Martha demanded.  "Do they think&mdash;I IMAGINED that vomiting?
Do they think I didn't try to believe I was all right?"
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Emily best to pass as lightly as possible over
even the word "hysteria."
</p>

<p>
"You were worried, Martha.  You were afraid."
</p>

<p>
"Well, of <i>course</i> I was afraid!  All the time I thought, suppose
anything should happen to me.  I was thinking all the time
about <i>you</i>, mother!  Do you think I wanted to disgrace you?
That's why I wanted to&mdash;I thought I couldn't live.  Oh, when
your wire came, mammie, I just had to see you again, <i>once</i>,
before&mdash;&mdash;  I didn't <i>want</i> to come.  I was afraid you might
find out!  But I <i>had</i> to come and see you again once!  How
did you happen to come, mammie?"
</p>

<p>
"Did you suppose I was going to let you wander around
New York alone?"
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you suspect anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Martha!  <i>No!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"No, you couldn't believe it.  Oh, I never wanted YOU to
know.  I'd rather have told all the rest of the world, mother.
I'll never forgive myself for this as long as I live.  You
look&mdash;sick as a dog, mammie!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm all right.  You needn't worry about <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p>
"You just say that.  You don't even scold me!  I've learned
my lesson.  You don't have to say anything!  My God!"
cried little Martha Kenworthy.  "What I've been through!
And those filthy women at school nosing around trying to find
out what was the matter with me!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Martha!"
</p>

<p>
"They <i>were</i>.  They went sneaking around!  They know too
much, those old hens, pretending they're so holy.  I'm finished
with that place!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, now&mdash;everything is all right."  It seemed better to
her to take that line.  "We can go wherever we want to.  You
need a rest.  We'll go South, if you want to."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Let's not go home.  Let's go South from here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well&mdash;I don't know.  I'd have to get some more clothes.
You'd&mdash;we'd better go home first.  And we have our tickets;
it's not much shorter from here."
</p>

<p>
"Dad might want to go with us&mdash;or drive us down."
</p>

<p>
"I think we better go by train.  It's much better to go home
first."
</p>

<p>
"You mean&mdash;so people can see me?  So nobody can suspect
anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Martha, I didn't mean any such thing.  Who's going to
suspect us of anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Not you, of course.  But I'll go home if you want me to.
I'll do anything you want me to, after this.  You've been a
brick; you've stuck by me; you're the one that needs a rest.
I don't look as ghastly as you do, mammie."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we can do anything we want to now; we can go any
place."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to do anything.  I just want to sleep a year."
</p>

<p>
So they left for home that night.  And the next day, as the
train hurried West, Martha's gloom and her humility deepened
mile by mile.  She sat looking steadily out of the window, and
Emily realized that it could not be the scenery that fixed the
expression of her face.  When her thoughts were recalled from
some unhappy distance, she considered her mother meekly, with
solicitude.  Her gratitude, the sort of indebtedness, was painful
to Emily.  After they had changed at Chicago into the train for
home, Emily realized, even before Martha spoke, that she was
hardening herself for an ordeal.
</p>

<p>
"Mammie," she said, "I don't want to&mdash;I mean&mdash;will you
let me have the guest room this time?  I think I could sleep
better in the guest room."
</p>

<p>
Emily Kenworthy had never taken a journey of any sort
whose very climax and last ineffable thrill had not been getting
back again into her very own house.  She was that sort of
woman.  But never before had she felt the joy of being at
home and of waking up in her own bedroom quite so keenly as
she did that morning.  She opened her closet and took down
her customary morning frock.  It was a brown jersey.  It
had a bit of tan-colored jersey down the front of it.  On the
tan-colored jersey were rows of little brown jersey buttons, and
those top two buttons were hanging loosely; those two loose and
familiar buttons were reality, surely.  They proved that New
York had been only a dream.  She put the verifying frock on,
and went out of her room, and in the hall the radiator was
burbling out its confirming burbles.  She sat down at her own
breakfast table; Bob was there, no phantom.  And the percolator
lid still had to be managed.  Its awkwardness had been
a family failing for months now.  Bob couldn't apparently
improve it.  Emily began pouring coffee, with her hands held as
that percolator must be held, and she could scarcely believe she
had been in New York.  Martha's hallucination was a nightmare,
and the percolator was truth and awakening.
</p>

<p>
She could indeed have believed that morning that the days
of terror had been a delirium if, in the guest room, the pitiful
stranger had not been lying in bed.  She was glad that Martha
seemed willing to stay there the first day or two, for it made
her story more impressive.
</p>

<p>
"It's this quarrel with us, Bob, that's worked on her mind
till she couldn't eat.  I wish you could have heard her that first
night.  She just cried and cried, because she was so sorry about
last summer, and ashamed.  She says she don't know what
possessed her to act so&mdash;naughty.  I had just to make her stop
crying.  I told her it was morbid; but I couldn't get her to eat.
I ordered everything, but she wouldn't take anything.  The
doctor says it's her nerves; she's got to have a long rest."
</p>

<p>
"But how'll you keep her from dancing, if you take her South?"
</p>

<p>
"She won't want to dance; she's too sick."
</p>

<p>
Bob seemed scarcely able to credit that, although he
acknowledged that she looked bad.
</p>

<p>
Emily went on: "She's so ashamed of the things she said to
you last summer, Bob.  She wanted me to apologize; or rather
I said I would, because she gets so worked up if she begins to
talk about it.  She said no girl ever had a better father than
you, Bob."
</p>

<p>
"Did she say that, honestly, now, Emily?"  Bob looked
troubled.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she did, sitting at a table, not eating a thing.  She'd
have burst out crying if I hadn't made her stop it."
</p>

<p>
"By heck!  Emily, the kid must be sick!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she is.  The doctor said I have to take good care of
her and keep her out of doors.  When you go in to see her,
Bob, just pretend nothing's happened.  Don't let her get started
apologizing."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Do you think&mdash;is she over that&mdash;that business
with that damned skunk?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I think so.  I think she's ashamed of it all."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's something, anyway."
</p>

<p>
It was the neighbors who began coming in at once to inquire
sympathetically about Martha, who kept Emily uneasy.
Each woman's solicitude seemed to necessitate the hurried
invention of new details, and Emily, not used to deceit, could
scarcely be sure her stories tallied.  Johnnie Benton gave her
a moment of difficulty.  He wouldn't be content with vagueness.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Mrs. Kenworthy, what is the matter with her,
when you get right down to brass tacks?"
</p>

<p>
"Tut, tut, Johnnie!  Do you think I haven't been right down
to brass tacks all the time?"
</p>

<p>
"Nervous breakdown, that's just a sort of excuse for
anything, I thought."
</p>

<p>
"You better think again.  A nervous breakdown isn't anything
to joke about."
</p>

<p>
"But isn't she going to get up?  Aren't we going to see
her at all?"
</p>

<p>
"She'll be up in a day or two.  But, look here, Johnnie, if she
prefers not to see you, I won't insist.  I'm not going to have
her annoyed&mdash;not a bit, just now."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not planning to annoy her."
</p>

<p>
"Now don't get fussy.  You know very well what I mean.
She must be humored."
</p>

<p>
The next day he sent in a great bunch of roses.
</p>

<p>
"These would go with the room, I thought," he said, meekly,
to Emily.
</p>

<p>
She hesitated about taking them in to Martha.  She decided
to do it, and regretted her decision, for Martha read the
message with them and tore it up angrily and began to cry.
</p>

<p>
Wilton ran in just to call, and asked about the New York
doctor.  He was very tactful, very kind.  Mrs. Benton came in
and gave Emily a terrible shock.
</p>

<p>
"I have half a notion to go South with you, Emily.  I can't
wait forever for my sister.  I was going to California with her,
but she keeps putting it off.  And, anyway, I don't know but
what I'd rather go with you."
</p>

<p>
Emily would not urge her to go with them.  She didn't dare
even mention such a possibility to Martha.  She thanked her
lucky stars that Mrs. Benton's sister was going to be terribly
angry if Mrs. Benton went with Emily.
</p>

<p>
When the girls came in, Martha said, wearily:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let them come up if they want to.  I suppose they've
got to see me, if they want to.  Hand me that vanity case,
mammie, please."  And she sat up and rouged a little bit, to
defy detection, as it were.
</p>

<p>
The third day she was home she got up and came downstairs
for lunch and supper.  "I won't have you carrying all those
things up to me," she said to Emily.  On Friday she happened
to be in the living room when Greta came in.  She received her
with little cordiality, and presently, as they sat there, Emily
doing most of the talking, two more girls came in.  Emily was
breathing a sigh of relief that the afternoon had passed so
smoothly, as they left.  But when she turned into the living
room from seeing them out, Martha burst out:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for the love of Heaven, let's get away, mammie!  I
can't <i>stand</i> this.  This house; this town.  Let's go to-night,
please, mammie!"
</p>

<p>
"We aren't ready."
</p>

<p>
"I am.  I'm packed.  I'll do your packing.  Let's get out of
this!"
</p>

<p>
Emily wondered when she had got her things out of her
painted room.  She had never seen her open the door of it.
She said: "I thought you didn't mind seeing the girls.  You
could have excused yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I could, and they would have been wondering why.
They make me so sick.  They just come prying about to see
what they can find out!"
</p>

<p>
"That's nonsense.  You oughtn't to talk that way.  They
came just naturally, because you weren't well."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and asked all those questions!"
</p>

<p>
Martha wasn't to be humored in this.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't see anything objectionable in what they asked,"
Emily responded dryly.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't?  Didn't you hear Greta asking where Eve was?
'What's become of Eve this vacation?' she said, just like that."
</p>

<p>
"Well, child, why shouldn't she ask you where Eve is spending
her holiday?  You've been in school with her all term.
You'd be supposed to know.  You forget that Eve about lived
in this house last summer."
</p>

<p>
"I forget it, do I?  Oh, look here, mammie, if I finish your
packing, won't you go to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Our reservations are for to-morrow night.  You know that."
</p>

<p>
"They'll change them; and if they won't, let's stay in Chicago
a night.  I'd rather stay any place in the world than here,
mammie."  She was pleading now, not resentfully, but humbly.
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Emily, "if daddy agrees."
</p>

<p>
Martha turned away impatiently.  In the presence of death
Bob Kenworthy had appeared a good father.  But Martha,
having now to face life, already found him only an irritation.
"It isn't Bob's fault this time that she wants to get away,"
Emily thought.
</p>

<i>Chapter Seven</i>
</h3>

<p>
They traveled directly south until they came to a town
which, stretching out along a blue-and-golden bay, had gone to
sleep before the Revolution and has never been disturbed since.
They found it all ease and dreams and laziness.  The shadows
of live oaks were its swiftest motion, and the dancing of oyster
schooners over its sea was all its din.  The Kenworthys arrived
in the middle of a sunny afternoon at the sort of hotel to which
they had been recommended.  Although they had written they
were coming, no one in authority was in sight to receive them.
A slovenly negro maid didn't know what rooms they were to be
in.  Leaving their baggage on the veranda, where the taxi driver
had deposited it, they walked down through a little garden to
the snow-white sands and the golden clear water of the bay.
An old man sitting on a bench, his legs wrapped around in a
traveling rug, was sleeping, his bald head nodding, nodding,
helplessly.  They walked out to the end of the little pier.  They
sat down, and looked into the crystal shallows as jellyfish lapped
about softly.  The sun on the water was a lullaby.  Emily
presently felt her eyelids growing heavy.
</p>

<p>
"This'll be a good place to sleep, anyway," Martha said.
The trouble was, in the days that followed, that Emily could
never be sure that Martha was sleeping.  Sometimes when
the girl went to her room and, closing the door, begged not to
be disturbed, Emily felt sure, as she sat listening involuntarily,
that she was lying sobbing heart-brokenly.  She never caught
her in the act&mdash;she avoided that&mdash;but the curves of Martha's
cheeks had the shadows and shape of many tears.
</p>

<p>
Emily had helplessly to sit and watch her progressing into
bitterness.  The first few days Martha said nothing; she
watched the sea by day; by night she sat and stared into the
fire.  When Emily spoke to her, she would turn and bring
herself into her mother's presence bewilderedly.  She would look
about her wonderingly, like a lost child in a strange world.
Emily's remarks seemed scarcely to reach her.  Her silence
was unnatural.  Certainly, Emily reflected, if she could utter
the thoughts that seemed to be grinding her down, she would
feel better.  She longed to have her begin talking again.
</p>

<p>
Hints came out from time to time.  Sometimes Martha was
not able to refrain from groaning.  The first afternoon they
walked away down the beach, they came to an old cemetery with
broken gnarled cypresses in it, and violets ready to bloom on
old French graves.
</p>

<p>
Emily said, instinctively, "Let's go in."  The gate stood open
before them.
</p>

<p>
But Martha cried, "NO!  I've had enough of THAT!"  She
shuddered.
</p>

<p>
What Martha said, when she began talking, was frightful.
She resorted to speech only when her sense of outrage had
become intolerable.  She burst forth with noise and fury.  It
happened one evening that Emily had tarried, partly because
Martha had refused so curtly from the first to pass even the
time of day with anyone in the hotel, to be civil to an old and
frail woman who sat alone at an adjoining table.  When she
went into her room, she found Martha in tears on her knees
before the fire.  She was always poking the fire; often she
poked it viciously.  But now she seemed to have attacked it
brutally.  She was tearing up papers, or something.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" Emily exclaimed.  And then she
saw.
</p>

<p>
"Why, <i>don't</i> do that!  That's a library book!"
</p>

<p>
But Martha was in a rage.  "I don't care if it is!  I'll burn
up every copy I ever get my hands on!" She wouldn't let
Emily rescue it.  The tears were running down her face.  "Such
lies!" she raved.  "How can you stand it?  Dirty, filthy, rotten,
vile lies!  That's what's the matter!  Books like that!  I could
kill that man!"
</p>

<p>
There was something sobering in the mere sight of a book
being torn to bits.  It was a strong book, powerfully written,
and it resisted its destruction.  The pages had to be jerked
out, almost one by one.  Martha kept tearing and poking, and
urging the flames on.
</p>

<p>
"Martha," Emily remonstrated, "you mustn't do that!  Don't
make it flame up more!"  She had never seen Martha in such
a rage.  She stood helplessly watching her folly.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you read it?" Martha cried to her.  There was
scarcely anything left of the book now, but the covers.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I read part of it," Emily began, protesting.
</p>

<p>
"You believed it, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I&mdash;I didn't care for it all, much."
</p>

<p>
"You didn't care for it!  My God!  I'm never going to read
a book written by a man again as long as I live!  It isn't that
they're fools only; it isn't possible for them to learn anything,
even, dirty fumbling idiots!"
</p>

<p>
"That's not very nice language, Martha."
</p>

<p>
"Language?  What's language?  Language isn't anything.
Look at the facts.  Are <i>they</i> nice?  Look what that rotten man
wrote down for people to read!"
</p>

<p>
Emily sat down, and Martha turned around and leaned her
head against her mother's knee and wept.  She kept trying to
express her contempt for the book and its author; she felt the
need of curses, but her vocabulary failed her.  "That horrid,
rotten person," she cried two or three times.  "That nasty brutal
old pig."  And Emily stroked her hair and wondered whether
to command her to keep still or to encourage her to talk it out.
"He says&mdash;&mdash;"  Martha sputtered at length, crying bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, child," Emily said quietly.
</p>

<p>
But Martha would mind.  She controlled her sobs.
</p>

<p>
"He says&mdash;the filthy old rotten&mdash;idiot&mdash;that man in the
book, he just went around&mdash;you know&mdash;mother&mdash;falling in love,
they call it&mdash;and then he threw one woman away, mammie,
because&mdash;he said&mdash;she didn't enjoy it!  Oh, I could <i>kill</i> that man!
<i>Enjoy</i> it, he said, mother!  He said she was always afraid!
My God!  <i>He</i> hadn't anything to lose.  He ran no risk!  They
just try to make out that women are like men, mother, so that
they can get them.  You'd think women would tell the truth,
wouldn't you, mammie?  I'd just like to see Mrs. Wharton be an
old maid and try to hide that child that way!  She'd learn a
thing or two.  It isn't fair, it's too cruel!  They just try to make
girls believe lies like that so they won't be afraid.  I was afraid,
all the time.  But why wasn't I afraid enough?  I must have
been crazy last summer.  Honestly, mother, I must have been
out of my mind, to do that.  It's women that are fools.  It was
my own fault.  Does it seem possible, mother, that women can
love such&mdash;such filthy, rotten messes as men?  I couldn't have
been in my right mind.  So it couldn't have been my fault,
and look what happened to me!  It makes me so mad to think
about it.  It isn't fair!  Why can't a woman just turn over and
go to sleep, too?  Why should she have two lives to risk, and a
rotten, dirty man none at all?  Mammie, you don't think I was
in my right mind last summer, do you?  I never would have
done that if I'd had any sense.  Were any of your people crazy,
mammie?  Were daddy's people insane?  I mean, two or three
generations back?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not so far as I know; not one of them.  You've got
sane people behind you.  Don't cry so, child.  It's going to be
all right yet."
</p>

<p>
"There's no use saying things like that.  I WAS crazy, mother.
I couldn't have&mdash;&mdash;  It doesn't seem possible.  If I hadn't been
out of my head, I never could have&mdash;loved him&mdash;a man.  Didn't
you ever notice anything strange about me last summer,
honestly?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I couldn't understand it, but&mdash;girls <i>do</i> fall in love.
Your father thought, though&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What did he think?" she urged.
</p>

<p>
"He sometimes thought you must be&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Crazy!  Did he say crazy?"  She was eager to have that
lesser sentence passed on herself.
</p>

<p>
"He <i>did</i> say crazy, but you know, Martha, how we say it.
Not meaning literally crazy."
</p>

<p>
"No, but I <i>was</i> crazy.  Look at the mess I got you into,
mother.  What would we ever have done with that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We don't need to talk about that now.  Don't mention it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we <i>do</i> need to talk about it.  I AM a woman.  I
WILL think about it.  It isn't fair!  It's cruel!"
</p>

<p>
And on she raved, groaning out the old old groanings.  Emily
sat overwhelmed and yearning, trying from time to time to ease
her hurt with the words of her happier experience.  Her
arguments were less threadbare, having been used from the first
only by women who felt themselves tenderly loved.
</p>

<p>
"It is hard luck to be a woman, if you're unlucky, Martha.
But if you're lucky, it's not women you're sorry for, but men."
</p>

<p>
"How can you say that?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, they haven't children; they can't have children; they
miss that, the realest joy.  After all, children do belong to
women.  You belong to me more than to your father."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I don't see through that?  I'm not a fool
NOW!  I do belong to you.  It's <i>you</i> I got into a mess.  Dad
sits home, not worrying.  And if he did know about it, he'd
blame you; he'd say you spoiled me.  It's lovely to have a
child like me!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't care, Martha.  Whatever has happened to you&mdash;to
us&mdash;you've been my happiness all these years.  I don't care
what you say, that's a fact.  This time will pass, and we'll
be happy again.  If you had a child, you'd understand."
</p>

<p>
"If!  Don't say 'if' to me!  Haven't I had a child?"
</p>

<p>
"No, you haven't.  You certainly haven't!"
</p>

<p>
"I certainly have!  Look here, mother, don't you really think
I go crazy, that I've been crazy twice now?  It's insane to be
hysterical!  Maybe I'll go stark crazy and get put in&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Martha!  Martha!"
</p>

<p>
They sat there till long after midnight.  Emily argued that
what Martha had done was not a symptom of insanity.  What,
then, was it, Martha demanded, sorely.  And Emily explained
the brutal fact that nothing in life is so perplexing, so inexplicable
to look back upon, as one's own conduct.  She found the girl
was full of the dread of publicity.  "If he could get his wife
to divorce him because of&mdash;me, he'd tell her in a minute!" she
cried once.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, surely not!" expostulated Emily.  She was on the point
of saying that Mr. Fairbanks would never allow that.  Then
she remembered bitterly that Mr. Fairbanks had promised to
prevent&mdash;other things, and had not been able to keep his
promise.
</p>

<p>
After all these dregs and outpourings, Emily took her into
her own bed, and realized, as she thought them over, that the
girl was lying sleepless beside her.  What, she wondered,
wearily, was there left for her now?  She had lost faith in her
lover and all mankind.  She had lost faith in herself; she had
lost confidence and security from fear.  But what she hated
most violently was her own self, that sweet little bathed and
powdered body which Emily had adored every day since her
birth.  The flowering of her body, its natural fruitfulness, was
what she resented unto death.  She was utterly undone.  She
had to be made anew.  It was a bitter task to take up.  "I'm too
old for it," Emily thought.
</p>

<p>
Martha rose in a business-like manner the next morning,
earlier than usual.  Usually from their beds they saw the
schooner they had called their own because it had castellated
patches on its sail, move like a dream of a castle through the
misty distance.  This morning they saw it together from their
place in the dining room.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to ask them to put a writing table in my room
this morning," Martha announced.  And when they were walking,
later, she suggested that they go down to the little stores
on Main Street.  She wanted, she said, to buy some paper.
</p>

<p>
Emily was curious because of the quality and quantity of
paper she ordered.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do with all that?" she asked,
naturally, as they left the shop.
</p>

<p>
Then Martha made her announcement, grimly: "I'm going to
write a novel."
</p>

<p>
Emily had supposed nothing could really surprise her ever
again.  She found she had been mistaken.  She was thoroughly
"taken aback."
</p>

<p>
Martha was suspicious of her silence.  "Why shouldn't I
write a novel?" she challenged.
</p>

<p>
"Why, how can you?  How can you begin?  I'd as soon&mdash;why,
I'd as soon try to make a whole train!"
</p>

<p>
"I can begin.  Don't you worry!  It's no trick to write a
novel!"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;&mdash;" murmured Emily, unable to agree.
</p>

<p>
"I made up my mind in the night; if nobody else will tell the
truth, I will!  Girls will know a thing or two when they get
through with my novel, I'll bet!"
</p>

<p>
Emily held her peace tightly.
</p>

<p>
Martha went on defiantly: "I've got its name and everything.
I'm going to call it 'Blistered Women'&mdash;like 'Flaming Youth,'
you know, or else, 'Vomiting Love'!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Martha!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you'll say 'Oh, Martha!' all right, when you read it!
They used to sit and lecture us about Romance and Realism
by the hour!  It took them hours!  Idiots!  Why couldn't they
just say: Romance is what men think about 'affairs,' the
pigs; and Realism is what women know.  Mine's going to be a
realistic novel!"
</p>

<p>
Emily looked at her and repressed her sighs.  She had on
that racoon coat and that small rosy hat.  She strode along with
her chin up, defying anyone to stop her.
</p>

<p>
After that morning Emily was free to do whatever she might
fancy.  She might sit in the sun on the veranda and knit, or
she might sit on the end of the pier and watch the waves.  She
might walk oyster-shell roads or sandy paths through turpentine
groves.  No plan of hers could entice Martha away from
that writing table.  She rose early, and she sat there day after
day from nine till one-o'clock lunch.  When Emily ventured
occasionally to go into her room, she would see her writing
away, and often her mouth was screwed up into hatred.  Her
face seemed to say that if scribbling could kill, there would be
wide slaughter&mdash;not of innocents.  And sometimes she would
be writing savagely, with tears running down her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
Emily might like this novel-writing&mdash;and sometimes she
thought it would do Martha good to get this resentment all out
of her mind, expressed in words&mdash;of she might disapprove&mdash;for
certainly Martha was working as she had never worked before
to Emily's knowledge&mdash;which couldn't be good for her
shattered nerves.  But she was helpless.  She knew if she
commanded Martha to stop it, Martha would refuse.  She had a
call now; she had a mission in life.  Somebody had to tell the
truth.  And men, of course, didn't even know what truth was,
and they wouldn't tell it if they did know.  Oh, they did make
her sick at her stomach!  Emily had to register her protest at
times against Martha's description of what she was writing.
</p>

<p>
"It's NOT a nice novel, I know that.  I never intended it
should be; but I'll tell you right now, it's a lot nicer than things
are in this world, mammie!"
</p>

<p>
In February Bob began writing of their coming home.  He
threatened&mdash;that was the word Martha used&mdash;to come down
and see them.  Emily would have welcomed him; she was lonely
and unhappy.  She said miserably to herself more than once
that what she needed was some wise and sympathetic person
with whom she might talk over Martha's plight.  If Bob was
neither wise nor sympathetic, he was always solicitous and
tender at heart.  And Martha was often irritable and
unreasonable, and sometimes unconsciously cruel.  She seemed at
times to look upon her mother as one of the wrongs life had
done her.  One afternoon they were standing together at the
end of the pier, looking at the opalescent sea and the flowery
clouds about the sunset.
</p>

<p>
She had begun, apropos of nothing but her constant musings,
"Mother, wasn't there something funny about Grandma Kenworthy?"
</p>

<p>
"Funny?  No.  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"But she was terribly religious, wasn't she?"
</p>

<p>
"She was&mdash;religious, certainly."
</p>

<p>
"But wasn't she sort of fanatical?"
</p>

<p>
"No, she wasn't!  Don't you remember her?  She was the
dearest old thing that I ever knew&mdash;the most companionable
woman."
</p>

<p>
"But somebody told me&mdash;or, anyway, I heard she used to
pray, when she was poor, and she used to believe her prayers
were answered, too."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that doesn't prove she was&mdash;funny.  You meant&mdash;not
quite right in her mind, didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  And people say&mdash;it's all sort of the same thing, being
too religious&mdash;or&mdash;you know&mdash;like me, mammie."
</p>

<p>
"Martha!  She was as sane as any woman!  What could she
do but pray?  She hadn't any health.  She hadn't any money
for her little boys.  All that woman went through&mdash;if she
hadn't had a strong mind, she would have gone crazy!  She
must have been far better balanced than most women, let me
tell you.  And look here, child&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Why do you go on thinking about insanity?  Don't you
see you only did what every woman does?  After all, every
woman who ever bore a child submitted to the preliminaries.
Didn't she, now?"
</p>

<p>
"Preliminaries!  My God, mother!  How you do talk!
You're so high and holy you never know what I mean!  Sometimes
I feel as if there was a gulf between us&mdash;a great wide
ocean!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Martha!"
</p>

<p>
"I do.  You can't understand, mammie, you're so good.  I
don't know how you could have had a child like me!"
</p>

<p>
That statement explained a good deal of Martha's conduct.
She had been acting exactly as if she had been acutely and
unhappily conscious of her separation from her mother, and
Emily tried to reason her out of it.
</p>

<p>
"We are infinitely nearer each other than we were last
summer, child!"
</p>

<p>
But that was an unfortunate way of putting it.  "Oh, don't
say last summer to me, <i>please</i>!" Martha cried.
</p>

<p>
A day or two later she announced, dryly: "There's no use
of my writing away at that novel.  I don't know how.  But
I'm going to learn how.  It isn't so easy as I thought.  I'm
going to start in at the University of Chicago the first of April.
I'm going to study English."
</p>

<p>
She plainly wasn't asking permission; she wasn't going to
tolerate advice; she had made up her mind.  And Emily, who
had been wondering what in the world to suggest for the
immediate future, was relieved.  It might be a very good thing.
It would be so great a change of life; it would supply new food
for thought.  She had not the vaguest idea that the novel would
ever come to completion.
</p>

<p>
She said, "Well, that's an idea.  But you must come home for
a few days, child!  To get your things, at least."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't want to.  You can send them to me, if I need
anything.  I never want to go back to that house again as long
as I live!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you feel that way&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You mean I ought to go back, so people won't talk, so
they won't suspect anything?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean any such thing!  People don't suspect you of
anything.  Get that idea out of your head!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why they shouldn't!" she retorted, cynically.
She was so unhappy, so abrupt and almost brutal, that Emily
forgot her good resolutions, after she was in bed that night,
and just wept.  She had to go home without her child.  In
spite of all that she had planned to prevent such a climax,
Martha hated that house now more vindictively than her
mother had ever hated it.  It wasn't Bob, either, that had driven
her away from it; it wasn't Bob that had alienated her from
her mother; it was just luck, it was fate.  There was no appeal.
"It's because I stood by her through all this that she can't
stand the sight of me now!" Emily wept.  "She's left me.
She's going to a hotel in Chicago alone, to get away from me."
</p>

<p>
The day of their departure Martha was all but intolerably
irritable.  Emily's patience was almost at an end.  She wasn't
sure but that her daughter needed at this late date a thoroughly
good spanking; but she held her peace.  It was fortunate
indeed that Emily had cultivated a good grasp on the peace of
her mind, for that day she clung to it desperately.  And then
it nearly got away from her, more than once.  However, as they
were getting into their train at New Orleans, Martha began,
abruptly:
</p>

<p>
"Look here, mother, it does make me sore to have you act
as if I couldn't go to a hotel and take care of myself without
you.  Don't you think I've learned my lesson yet?  Do you
think I'm as much of a fool yet as I was last summer?  What
can hurt a girl alone in a hotel but men?  I'm as safe as if
I was in a desert, or locked in a cell.  If all the men in Chicago
were on the bridge, and I got a chance, I'd push them into the
river, filthy little rats!  I'd watch them sink.  I should think
you'd understand that by now.  But you've been good to me,
I know that.  And if it will make you any happier, I'll go to
the Y.W.C.A. and stay there till I get a flat.  Does that
satisfy you?"
</p>

<p>
It was so magnificent a concession that Emily blinked.  "Oh
yes, I think that would be much better.  I'd like that, Martha."
</p>

<p>
"All right, then.  <i>I</i> won't like it; lots of old cats there; but
I don't want you to be worrying about me.  I can take care of
myself, I should hope."
</p>

<h3>
<i>Chapter Eight</i>
</h3>

<p>
Wherever Emily went, at home again, she was beset by
loquacious pilgrims returned from a winter in the South or in
the West.  At every gathering of women, the hum and babble
held to that subject.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my brothers have cleared three hundred thousand on
their Florida deals.  And we're selling our house and leaving
in October.  After all, as I said to John, what's the use of
slaving at housework in Illinois when you can get colored girls
in Florida to do your work?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'd rather freeze scrubbing floors in Illinois than have
those horrid black women slopping around my house.  Do you
know, Emily, what one of them actually said to me?  There
were no knobs or handles or anything on the bureau drawers
in my room.  Shiftless things!  And when I protested, the
maid said: 'Well, you don't need no handles.  Leave a stocking
hanging out, and give it a jerk and the drawer will come open.'  I
wouldn't stay in that hotel a day longer.  I just told Peter I'd
stood enough.  That's why we went to Daytona."
</p>

<p>
"I can tell you a place where everything isn't swimming in
cold grease.  They have a Northern cook.  Deliver me from
Southern fried cooking."
</p>

<p>
"And I found that all the cream that was to be had was
shipped in from Kentucky.  That's three or four hundred miles.
Imagine a town that has to ship in cream!  They have to
paint their cows, or something, and it don't agree with them."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you'd gone to California in the first place.  We've
got our rooms reserved for next year.  The view is superb.
It scarcely rains at all there."
</p>

<p>
"I never was so sick of glare in my life.  I just thought, let
me get back to Illinois.  That's good enough for me."
</p>

<p>
"The trouble with them is, they won't tip enough.  It pays
to hand out money, on the coast, to be comfortable."
</p>

<p>
And then they would turn upon Emily, to insist gluttonously
upon details of Martha's health.  She had acquired a skill in
suave evasion that surprised her continually.  It had all worked
out very well, she would tell them.  Martha was much better.
She hadn't her color back, but that would come.  Of course,
Emily had thought it would have been better for her not to
go back into college so soon; but she was so ambitious.  After
she had fallen behind her classmates in her college, she thought
she would stay nearer home, in Chicago.  So lucky that they
had the quarter system in the university there.  And if Martha
didn't seem able to do the work, Emily would take her out at
once.  It was easier to keep an eye on her health if she studied
in Chicago, and she was living just now at the Y.W.C.A.  No
one could detect a flaw in the Kenworthy respectability.  "Why
should I suppose anyone suspects us of anything?" Emily asked
herself.  "I've just got that habit from Martha!"
</p>

<p>
She wanted every single passing day that spring to go and
see her daughter.  And every day she had to remind herself
that her daughter was not anxious to be reminded of her folly.
Her letters were short and not frequent.  And then she wrote
briefly that she had taken a room in an apartment of May
Bissel's.  Emily pondered that information dejectedly.  Martha
must be a very lonely girl if she had been forced back on to
May Bissel for comradeship, for certainly at home she would
have scorned her.
</p>

<p>
She abased herself to seek out Mrs. Bissel, to make inquiry
about the news.  Mrs. Bissel gushed and reassured her.  May
hadn't an apartment alone.  No, indeed!  Her mother wouldn't
allow that, not for a moment.  She and two other girls had a
sitting room and two bedrooms which they rented by the month
in the apartment of a grammar-school teacher.  This Miss
Curtis used her kitchen from six-thirty until seven-thirty in the
morning, and allowed the girls to use it for their breakfast for
an hour after seven-thirty.  They had their lunches and their
dinners out.  Miss Curtis kept an eye on May.  Not that May
tolerated any real chaperonage, of course, but Mrs. Bissel felt
always that, if May really got sick, or anything happened to
her, Miss Curtis would be there to let her mother know.  Miss
Curtis was a thoroughly dependable woman, and she came from
a town in western Iowa where Mrs. Bissel's sister lived.
</p>

<p>
And that was all the comfort Emily had.  Every day she
said to herself time and again: "No, I must not go.  She doesn't
want to see me; she told me so flatly."  Finally&mdash;it seemed
finally&mdash;though it was only six low-spirited weeks after they
had parted in Chicago, Martha wrote and asked her mother to
come and see her.  The letter was not affectionate; it was
scarcely cordial.  Either Martha was ashamed of the way she
was treating her mother, or she was intolerably lonely.  Emily
didn't know which.
</p>

<p>
When she saw the place her daughter of the painted room
was living in, she marveled at her endurance.  It was an apartment
building which had been got ready hastily and cheaply for
the Columbian Exposition.  On the second floor front was a
muddily tempestuous living room which Martha shared with
the two girls.  She showed it to her mother contemptuously.
"Imagine sitting in a place like this.  The art student did
it&mdash;the one whose place I took.  When they offer anybody a chair,
they dump its contents out on to the floor.  They're simply
pigs."  Out of this front room a tiny front bedroom opened,
which was Martha's.  It was the most comfortable room in the
house.  "I bought those curtains and the bedspread; but feel
them, mammie.  They've been up three weeks now, and they're
grimy.  That smoke comes in from across the street."  She
spoke dispiritedly.  Behind the living room was a bedroom with
one window which the two girls shared; behind that, off a dark
hall, another bedroom, rented to a "medic"; behind that, the
dining room where Miss Curtis lived; behind that, the kitchen.
It was only at second sight that the bathroom seemed disgusting.
It was all dark, smoke discolored, meager.
</p>

<p>
Her work in the university wasn't bad, she said.  She wrote
a theme every day, and it was good practice.  She had to read
a lot of trash in her literature courses.  "I have to read every
day a novel some silly flea or other wrote."  (Males had been
pigs a few months ago in her estimation.  They had shrunk
to rats, and now what less could they become than fleas? Emily
wondered.)  "I don't finish them.  I get too sick.  They
revolt me.  I tabulate them.  Look, mammie!"  She showed
Emily a large notebook.  "Here's seventeen what they call great
novelists, and only two of them know anything, really.  If they
show any signs of knowing the difference between men and
women, I put them in this column.  'Brass-tackers' I call them.
Funny they're both Russian, isn't it?  All the rest of the idiots
are here."  She had labeled them "Preliminaries," because they
think that's all there is to it.  "Oh, mammie, you must read
<i>Crime and Punishment</i>.  Dostoieffsky knew.  That poor little
Sonia, mother!  I'll lend you this.  She just covered herself
up with a green shawl and shuddered when she came in.
You could just see her shudder, if you were in that room."  But
in that room on Fifty-seventh Street no one saw Emily
Kenworthy shuddering.  "And that!" Martha pointed scornfully
to a volume of Wells.  "They make me read even <i>that</i> sort
of stuff.  You wait till people read my novel; I'll bet you they'll
begin to see through those men.  Why does Wells have all his
maternal women sort of freaks, or something, and all his
heroines not maternal?  There's a reason, believe me!"
</p>

<p>
"Are you still working on the novel?"
</p>

<p>
Martha turned on her indignantly.  "Well, I like <i>that</i>!  What
did you think I was putting up with this filthy place for?"
</p>

<p>
Emily suggested timidly at least occasional week-ends at
home.
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk to me about that!" Martha pleaded.
</p>

<p>
Emily went back thoroughly discouraged.  Was that any
place of healing for the child?  It was no change, if Martha
was to go on working on that volume of hate.  She was as
hard as ever; she was thinner and she was yellow.  All the
comfort Emily found was in saying over and over to herself
a line which had no connection in her mind with anything.
She thought vaguely perhaps it came from the Bible.  "What
wound did ever heal but by degrees?"  She tried often to think
of what followed; of another wording for it.  It was that line,
which she felt she was not saying correctly, that she lived by.
And sometimes, there in her living room, she thought of
Mr. Fairbanks' unfortunate daughter.  Her wound, he said, had
never healed; it had corrupted and poisoned her.  "I spoiled
her," Emily would muse.  "She's been taken away from me;
I've got to stand aside."  And then she would say again,
because she couldn't help it, "What wound did ever heal but by
degrees?"
</p>

<p>
She went on despising life.  She would not desist from
protesting against it.  She said, "If only Martha had quarreled
with Bob, I could go to her, sometimes.  I could live with her
in Chicago.  I don't suppose she will come back to this house
now, if I should die.  I never thought she would hate both me
and the house.  I must do something now, to keep from thinking.
I better adopt a child for a while.  I ought to write and
ask somebody to come and stay with me this summer.  There's
that old Miss Jenson; but Bob would never stand her.  Or
we might do over all the rooms downstairs.  If Martha would
only come and help me.  But if she would come and help me, I
wouldn't need to do it!  I believe I'll try hybridizing
hemorocalis.  Or what in the world will I do?  If only I had had a
house full of children!  If Bob would only take an hour or
two off, now and then!  I've got to settle down to this.  I
mustn't fuss because Martha can't endure the sight of me.  It's
my own fault.  I spoiled her, some way.  But I never meant
to! ... Thank God, it's time to clean house!"
</p>

<p>
But now, as always, she entered that festival with no
high-hearted challenge to mess and accumulation.  She followed
Maggie from room to room loyally but without enthusiasm.
The idea of leaving the abandoned painted room stagnant never
entered the head of the old servant.  She attacked it so
furiously that Emily hadn't the heart to say to her that all her
burnishings would be futile.  She shut its door at last with
the feeling of spineless hope she had when she looked, for
some justifiable reason, at the baby clothes she had folded away.
There they were, all ready at hand, in case she ever by some
good luck might need them again&mdash;not that there was much
hope, of course.  She loitered along after Maggie into the next
battlefield.
</p>

<p>
And then, when it was all done, when on the newly painted
veranda every summer chair had its freshest garments tied on,
Emily, being finished with dust, washed her hair one day and
dried it in the sun in the garden, remembering how Martha
always protested against the waste of time which so much long
thick hair took for drying.  It seemed almost as if the spring
and weather, pleased with the way the brown hair rippled in its
dampness, laid a trap to catch the little girl who had played
in that garden.  For then a shower came up, after noon, and
passed over, and the sun came out with a dazzling soft afternoon
brilliance.  In the blossoming apple trees orioles were
calling, and robins were hopping about in the wet petals below
them.  The grass was all young, and heavenly green, and the
air had a soft and glittering cleanness.  It was an afternoon
to make even the dull feel that to forget its very quality was
to have lived in vain.  Emily had played about in the garden
all the afternoon.  She came into the house to get some labels
stowed away in a drawer in her desk.  She sat down and
began sorting them&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
And into the living room, bareheaded, laden with coats and
bags, walked Miss Martha.
</p>

<p>
She came in quietly, as if it had been an ordinary coming.
She was bringing some one to her mother.
</p>

<p>
"This is Miss Curtis, mother," she explained.  "We drove
out.  It was such a nice day.  I suppose you can put us up?
Gee!  It smells good here!  How long till supper?  We're
starved, mammie.  Sit down, Miss Curtis, I'll bring the things
in myself!"
</p>

<p>
Emily saw a large and flabby-looking woman, in a nondescript
tan-colored coat and a small black hat, who might have been
fifty.  She pulled off her hat and apologized for the untidiness
of her stringy hair, and good reason she had for apologizing.
She had a rather fine square face; she had kindly eyes.  But
the most impressive thing about her was her utter weariness.
</p>

<p>
And Martha came in again, with more bags and parcels.
</p>

<p>
"Can't we have asparagus for supper, if I go out and cut it?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
Miss Curtis was eager to get out into the garden.  There
was not a moment to be lost.  The immortal afternoon was
wearing away.  They would only run up to their rooms.
</p>

<p>
"Can I have the little guest room, mammie?" Martha had
asked.  "I want her to have the big one."
</p>

<p>
And presently there she was, just as if nothing had happened,
coming out of the house and down the path towards her mother
and Miss Curtis, under the willow tree, bareheaded and carrying
the very old colander and the very old knife she had used
for cutting asparagus ever since, as a little girl, she had been
allowed that privilege.
</p>

<p>
"You've never eaten asparagus unless you've cut it," she
was explaining to her guest.  "Ten minutes from the garden
to the kettle, that's when it's good, really."
</p>

<p>
She was better, Emily said to herself.  She was subdued; she
was thoughtful of her guest.  She had ceased, for the moment,
to rail.  She was showing Miss Curtis all the garden.  The
asparagus had already been cut once that day, for Bob was
fond of it.  But there was enough just for two.  And this
warm rain would bring more on by to-morrow.  And she took
what she had found into the house, and returned to show her
wild-flower bed.
</p>

<p>
"Look what a little cultivation does for violets here.  They
aren't really modest, under mossy stones.  They're only starved.
They get swanky enough when you give them a place to grow,"
she said.  "And look at the Dutchman's breeches!  And here's
my old jack-in-the-pulpit.  And look at the peonies!  Gee,
mammie!  Mrs. Benton will be budding all over the county
before long."  She made Miss Curtis admire her willow tree,
and the clear water gurgling along beneath it.
</p>

<p>
"You're a glutton for education, Martha," Miss Curtis sighed,
"to be living with me in the city when you might be out here
at home!"  And she went in to get ready for supper.
</p>

<p>
Left alone for a moment with her mother, Martha stood
sniffling.
</p>

<p>
"I had forgotten it smelled so good, so clean!" she said,
wistfully.  "I simply hate Chicago.  It's just sickening when spring
comes.  Everybody goes out of town for week-ends.  All the
teachers go down to the dunes, and bring nice little mossy things
back with them, mammie.  That's why I came out here.  They
wanted Miss Curtis to go with them; and she wanted to, too.
But she can't afford it; it costs two or three dollars, she says.
It would cost me ten!&mdash;to go away for a week-end.  She's
such a good old dear, isn't she, mammie?  I tried to get her to
go some place with me for the week-end.  But she wouldn't
hear of me paying the bills.  I did want her to get away.  And
then she said I could come down and visit her school; and I did.
My God! mammie!  If you could see that room of hers on a
spring afternoon.  Close is no word for it.  Smelling of all
the dirty little wops that have never been bathed in their lives.
All wiggling and squirming and wanting to get out of doors, of
course.  I tell you I could hardly stand it for an hour.  And to
see her sticking shut up in there, day after day, for six years!
It made me so mad!  I just made up my mind to bring her out
here for the week-ends.  That wouldn't cost her even the price
of a bed.  I went and bought a car, and she hadn't an excuse left.
I'm going to put her to bed after supper.  She's ready to
collapse.  She had a chill the other evening, she was so done
up.  We had to get the doctor.  If you'd seen that room, you'd
wonder why she isn't dead.  Isn't she a sort of nice old thing,
mammie?"
</p>

<p>
"It is for this woman's sake she has come home," Emily
was trying not to think.  "She never realizes <i>I'm</i> lonely.  I'm
only her mother, after all!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure she needs a change, Martha.  Are you still getting
her suppers?"
</p>

<p>
"You wait till you see what a good cook I'm getting to be!
There is stuff you can get to eat for thirty cents, if you hunt
round.  Oh!" exclaimed Martha Kenworthy.  "There's dad
home.  I heard the car stop," she sighed.
</p>

<p>
In the living room she confronted him.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, kiddo!" he cried.  "You here?"  He looked at
Emily, and then he grew cordial.  He knew <i>he</i> couldn't have
made his wife's face shine so.  "It's pretty good to see you
again!"  He kissed her.  "You drove down?  Did you borrow
the car from the fire department?  Whose is it?"
</p>

<p>
"It's mine," said Martha.
</p>

<p>
"No!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's mine."
</p>

<p>
"Huh!  I'd have given you one at wholesale."
</p>

<p>
Emily knew Bob felt brutally slighted.  If there was one
subject on which he might expect a daughter to ask his advice,
surely it was on the purchase of a car.  Emily felt that, but
Bob never uttered one word of complaint.  It was unexpected
nobleness of him.  She knew why: he had been worried by her
dejection and loneliness.  If having that girl at home made
Emily gay again, he was determined not to antagonize her.
</p>

<p>
So peace reigned over the asparagus at the supper table.
Emily got the candles out, because Martha loved them.  And
when the fragrant dusk deepened, it was Martha who rose to
light them, as usual.
</p>

<p>
"Don't they make just a sweet light here?" she asked Miss
Curtis.  She sat looking at them flickering; she watched the
shadows of them, and the way they lit up the apple-blossom
bouquet she had brought in.
</p>

<p>
She studied the room wistfully.  "I'd forgotten the dining
room was so large," she remarked.  She seemed reluctant to
leave the candle-light when supper was over.  So the three
women sat on; Martha sat with her elbows on the table,
dreaming towards the little flames, as she had always done, but
taking her part in the conversation thoughtfully.  Her one
thought seemed to be for Miss Curtis's enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
Miss Curtis was interested in Mrs. Benton, and Martha
rehearsed the history of the swimming park, with now and then
a twinkling comment, not spontaneous, a remark calculated to
entertain her guest, who questioned her.  Emily occasionally
took her eyes from Martha's face long enough to glance at Miss
Curtis.  Even dusk and twilight failed to make her interesting.
She looked now only like complete fag.  But Martha was
mysterious, tantalizing to maternal interest.  She was thin, still.
She was hushed; but she was steady.  She was safe.  Miss
Curtis wasn't sitting apprehensively waiting for outbursts of
bitterness.
</p>

<p>
Martha had planned to drive Miss Curtis and her mother on
Saturday some distance down the river, and have a picnic.  The
day was fine enough, but Miss Curtis found herself extremely
tired from her ride of the day before; besides, as she said,
the garden itself was a picnic for her; she would be content to
stay there for months.  Martha had come downstairs that morning
dressed for the day, as soon as Bob had left the house, and
had proceeded to the kitchen, where she had got a tray daintily
ready for her guest; and she had carried it up to her as if she
had always been in the habit of preparing early breakfast for
people.  Then she had carried an easy chair and cushions and
rugs out almost to the river; and in the sun she had prepared
a sleeping-place for their morning, where they could all three
watch the orioles in the apple trees, and Martha could lie
about on the grass, now and then exerting herself to dig up a
dandelion.  In the afternoon Miss Curtis, with a book, slept
there, while Martha, putting in the later "glads" with her
mother, watched the untidy head nodding towards rest with
obvious satisfaction.  When she woke, after a few minutes, she
recalled her duty.
</p>

<p>
"Really, I ought to 'phone Mrs. Bissel that I'm here," she
told Martha.
</p>

<p>
But Martha said: "We should worry.  You can call her
up&mdash;next week&mdash;or the next time we're down."
</p>

<p>
Emily heard that with satisfaction.  She had known all the
day that Martha avoided even the front garden, where the
neighbors would the more surely learn of her return.  It was
lucky, the way everyone happened to be too busy to "run in"
that Saturday or Sunday.
</p>

<p>
When the unworthy red car drove away on Sunday afternoon,
both its passengers declared it had been a most successful
week-end.  Emily understood why Martha could say that
truthfully.  She had wanted Miss Curtis to enjoy it, and Miss
Curtis had enjoyed it, and that was enough justification for it.
It had been, in a way, a triumph for the house.  Martha had
said she never wanted to see it again as long as she lived, and
she had seen it, not unhappily.  She had even acknowledged its
dearness, she had stayed in the house with her father, and
she must have seen that when they both tried to, they could get
along without disagreement.  She had promised, moreover,
chuckling over her success, to bring Miss Curtis back just as
soon as possible.  Miss Curtis had asked her to, cunningly.
For Emily had taken Miss Curtis aside, and begged her, some
way, to get Martha out again soon for a week-end.  Martha
needed the change so much, Emily had pleaded.  Miss Curtis
had agreed to that.
</p>

<p>
"And she won't leave that work of hers for a day, as you
know, unless she thinks she's doing you a great favor," Emily
had insisted.
</p>

<p>
Miss Curtis was eager to do Mrs. Kenworthy whatever favor
she could.
</p>

<p>
"Only get Martha to bring you down; bring her home some
way!" Emily had pleaded, not adding, "That's more than I
can do!"
</p>

<p>
So for four week-ends the unequal pair arrived.  Martha
brought all sorts of treats out for her guest, thick steaks and
expensive chocolates.  "I'm not going to have you doing it
all, mammie!" she had answered to Emily's protests.  She was
always in the kitchen now, helping Maggie.  Emily understood
that the kitchen was the part of the house least tainted by
memories.  She was still rising to take breakfast up to Miss
Curtis.  Emily scarcely ever got her to stay late in bed,
although she was herself distressingly thin and yellow.
</p>

<p>
From Sunday till Friday Emily spent every free moment
thinking over all that her daughter had said, all the expressions
of her face; all the gestures of her significant little hands.
It had been impossible, of course, for Martha to avoid
her old friends altogether.  She received them patiently,
gravely.  "That poor old thing's got to have these days in
the country," her manner seemed to her mother to say, "so I
just have to put up with these silly, giggling girls for her
sake."  She felt separated from them by a great distance; she got on
better with people of Miss Curtis's age, even with Mrs. Benton.
That neighbor was showing Martha unusual attention.  Emily
couldn't help wondering if Mrs. Benton was coming to wish
Martha would marry her boy.  Why should she have made a
point of showing Martha's guest such kindness?  She had a little
lunch in her honor.  Emily marveled to see how Martha seemed
to belong to that tableful of women in their forties.  Mrs. Benton
wanted Miss Curtis to come out for the annual opening
of the beach.  She suggested that Martha take a class of
little girls who wanted to learn dancing during the summer.
</p>

<p>
At that suggestion Martha announced flatly that she wasn't
going to be home for the summer.  She had decided to go on
studying during the summer quarter.  "I lost such a lot of
time last winter, when I wasn't well, that I've got to make it
up," she announced, seriously, looking straight and frankly
at Mrs. Benton.
</p>

<p>
This zeal for education led Cora Benton to say later to
Emily, "You ought to be thankful Martha wants to study all
summer."  And she gave such a sigh that Emily said, quietly:
</p>

<p>
"What's the news from Johnnie?  When's he to be home?"
</p>

<p>
"He's flunked.  He isn't going to get his degree.  He's not
coming home!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Cora, that's too bad!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I was prepared for it.  Charles Fenton got a traveling
scholarship.  I wish you'd spread the news, Emily.  I don't
enjoy announcing it, especially."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, Cora."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you'd say that."
</p>

<p>
"What else can I say?" retorted Emily.
</p>

<p>
"I know it.  There isn't anything to be said; but people will
find enough to talk about, you know that."
</p>

<p>
"Has he got a job?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; that is&mdash;a sort of a job."  Her voice forbade even
friendly inquiry.
</p>

<p>
Martha said, when Emily told her of it, "I bet he's gone into
the movies."
</p>

<p>
Emily was annoyed by her cynical comment.
</p>

<p>
"Why should you think Johnnie's gone into the movies!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it would be just like him; and he's got such lovely
ears.  People who can move their ears the way he can never
have nice ones, really.  Or else he's playing baseball, or rubbing
them down, or something."
</p>

<p>
Later Emily ventured timidly to protest against Martha's plan
for the summer.  Although in Miss Curtis's quieting presence
Martha never railed, still, when she was with her mother alone,
there came forth at times spurtings of molten resentment and
red-hot bitterness against the nature of things in general, and
her nature in particular, so that Emily was never sure what
the effect of her words might be.  On this occasion Martha
turned upon her quickly, in a manner which cried, "Get thee
behind me, Satan!"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you want me to give up my novel altogether!  It's
not so easy as I thought.  I've started to do it all over.  I didn't
even know what form was, when I began.  It's all out of
proportion!  And you want me just to loaf.  If I don't tell the
truth about things, who's going to, I'd like to know?  Do
you think I'm going to let all these idiots that call themselves
realists just go on spoofing girls, and never say a word to
them?  I'm going to have it all done by Christmas, and send it
to some publisher."
</p>

<p>
One day the second week of July she called Emily up from
Chicago by 'phone.  Could she bring Miss Curtis and a little
niece down for a week or two?  Could she, indeed!  When
Emily told Bob about that 'phone message, he looked at her.
She thought it pitiful that he should say with exaggerated
eagerness:
</p>

<p>
"Good!  That's fine, Emily."

<p>
Emily thought at first sight that Saturday morning, that
the child was quite as commonplace as her aunt.  She was
inclined to be fat; she was shy; she had a featureless little
soft face, and blue eyes, and brown bobbed hair and a husky
voice; but by noon Emily loved her.  Her disposition evoked
admiration.  She had a way of going suddenly to her aunt and
kissing her heartily, that was very spontaneous and endearing.
Without warning, as they all sat at the dinner table, she rose
from her place and went and threw her fat arms about Miss
Curtis's neck and gave her a resounding kiss, as though it
was the only thing to do, and then quietly went back to her
chair.  Bob was amused by her lack of self-consciousness; and,
during dessert, he acquired quite suddenly an admiration that
was all but awe for Miss Curtis.
</p>

<p>
She had happened to say that she had never, as a matter of
fact, been so well at the end of a school year.
</p>

<p>
"But of course I was never so well taken care of in my life."  She
was speaking towards Emily.  "Never in my life, before,
Mrs. Kenworthy, have I happened to&mdash;be living&mdash;so that
anybody brought my breakfast to me in bed.  That's never
happened to me before."  It wasn't a complaint; it was merely a
fact, stated impersonally.
</p>

<p>
Emily knew perfectly what she meant, but she had to ask
the question to enlighten Bob.
</p>

<p>
"Your colored girl comes early, then, now?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not the colored girl; this little white girl," she said, indicating
Martha affectionately.  "This girl simply bosses me about
I don't dare to get up and get my breakfast, in my own house."
</p>

<p>
Martha said: "Oh, that's nothing.  Mother always did that
for me."
</p>

<p>
Emily saw that Bob was on the point of crying, "My God!"  She
blessed him for refraining.
</p>

<p>
But afterwards he said to her: "Well, you wouldn't think it,
to look at her, but there's something in that woman, Emily;
she's a great woman!  I didn't suppose anybody in the world
could get that girl up in the morning.  Don't you think the
kid's sort of different?"
</p>

<p>
"Improved, you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes, I guess so."
</p>

<p>
"She's found somebody who needs her help.  She always
was a tender-hearted child, and she's sorry for Miss Curtis.
She just about runs her flat for her."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope she'll stick around awhile.  She'll do the kid
good."
</p>

<p>
Emily was on the point of retorting, "She does you good
yourself!" for Bob's somewhat tentative forebearance was in
part due to the stranger's presence.  When there had been
young girls at the table, Bob could "roast" Martha and them
all together in one breath.  And Martha, who had established
herself as a protector and commander of a woman like Miss
Curtis, couldn't act like a baby before her when she was with
her father.  Emily was beginning to see that Miss Curtis,
pretending to be so docile, managed Martha by means of the
slightest little hints of ridicule.  By one smile she could take
all the wind out of Martha's naughty sails.
</p>

<p>
Emily was moved by the grave and tender manner in which
Martha took charge of the child, to relieve the aunt.  She had
told her on the way down that there was in her mother's house
a rainbow room prepared for little girls, so that the child went
into it eagerly, and accepted it as gravely as Martha gave it to
her.  Its builder and maker opened all its drawers and
cupboards, displayed the electric stove and the fudge-making
dishes.
</p>

<p>
Miss Curtis was on the point of expressing surprise that
she hadn't seen the room before.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we keep it locked; we never show it to anybody.  It's
too awful.  Mother let me have it done over to suit myself,
and I can't endure the sight of it!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know; I think it's&mdash;rather&mdash;a nice room&mdash;after
you've looked at it a little."
</p>

<p>
Emily was there.  She felt Martha was annoyed for the
moment by her presence.
</p>

<p>
She said, "It's a lovely room; it grows on you."
</p>

<p>
"If I was you I'd have it papered, mammie.  Make it into
a good guest room."
</p>

<p>
"I will not!" said Emily, emphatically.  Did Martha suppose
she would just agree to the idea that there should be no
daughter's room any longer in the house?
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid Ruth might spoil something, Martha.  You don't
mean to let her turn your stove on.  Ruth, don't do that!"
</p>

<p>
"She can't hurt anything.  The first day it rains I'll show
her how to make candy up here, or maybe we'll cook a little
supper up here and invite your aunt and my mammie."  And
Martha smiled gravely at the happy child.  "Nice days like
this it's better to play out in the yard.  I'm going to show
you how to make a beautiful kind of a playhouse out there."
</p>

<p>
They were running in and out of the house, collecting their
house-building material.  They were up in the tree.  Emily
could have imagined that Jim Kenworthy was playing there in
the garden with his little niece.  For, after a little, four pieces
of rope came dangling down from certain limbs of that tree.
Presently they were weighted down taut by four bricks tied
to them, just missing the grass.  These ropes were the four
corners of the house.  In a few minutes the walls of old sheets
were being safety-pinned into place.  And a fifth taut rope
came down for the side of the door.  And the rag rugs were
being spread on the grass inside.  "And where are those old
little chairs, mammie?  Where are my old things?  Where's
my little table been put?"  They were running up and down
from the attic, dustily.  At dinner time Ruth was more
talkative than ever before.  Nobody else knew how to build as nice
playhouses as Uncle Jim, she told her auntie as they sat down.
He had invented that kind of playhouse.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Jim who?" asked Bob, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Ruth looked blank.  "I don't know Uncle Jim who," she
said.  "I just mean Martha's Uncle Jim."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Bob.  He looked at her keenly.  He looked at
Emily.  "Funny," his face seemed to say, "to hear this child
of a stranger talking about Jim."
</p>

<p>
Ruth babbled on.  She seemed to know a surprising lot about
Uncle Jim.  She had appropriated him along with the painted
room and the playhouse.  After lunch she took Bob by the
hand and led him out to see it.
</p>

<p>
Emily hoped Martha saw the two of them walking down
the path together.  The sight some way made her think of Bob in
the graveyard on Decoration Day&mdash;standing looking at the
tombstone he had erected there for his beloved brother.  In
spite of Emily's protest he had engraved on it: "In
memory also of his son James Kenworthy, 1903-1918&mdash;who
died an unnecessary death, alone and unafraid."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Benton, of course, had been in and seen Ruth.  At
once she had given orders to the guard that the child was to
have special swimming lessons.  And she was at the beach
with her aunt, the fourth day of their visit, when Martha,
having driven Emily about the town on some errands, turned
the car towards the country.
</p>

<p>
"I want to tell you something, mammie!" she had said.
</p>

<p>
Emily was gratified that Martha cared to talk to her alone,
for although she had been polite, always when Miss Curtis was
there, she had been distant.  Now she chose a road little
traveled, and, settling down to drive slowly, she burst abruptly
into intimacy.
</p>

<p>
"Mother, I want to tell you something!  It's the most surprising
thing you ever heard in your life!  You won't believe
it!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I will."
</p>

<p>
"Well, guess who Ruth <i>is</i>!  <i>Guess</i>, mammie!"
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Isn't she Miss Curtis's brother's child?"
</p>

<p>
"She's Miss Curtis's own child.  She's her mother, mammie!"
</p>

<p>
Emily was dazed.  She murmured her incredulity.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>told</i> you you wouldn't believe it!  You could have knocked
me down with a feather when she told me.  Did you ever
hear of such a thing in your life?  It's too funny, mother.
Why did we take so to each other, in the first place?  Why did
she understand me so?  Because she'd been through the same
hell herself!  It's too strange!"
</p>

<p>
"Why Martha!  How old is she?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how old she is, exactly.  I don't think she's
more than thirty-five.  She kept the child with her for four
years; then she had to have more money, and she came to
Chicago to teach, and left her there, not at her own house,
but in Iowa.  She was a very delicate child, and she couldn't
leave her and go teaching, with just anybody.  She has an
awfully good home for her, and she's going to bring her to
Chicago when she starts high school, if she keeps well.
Imagine, mammie!  It makes me boiling mad when I think of
that woman slaving away to support that child, and some
damned man running around not caring.  Isn't she magnificent,
mammie?  Being good to all those dirty kids in her school!
That's why she never has a cent to spend; that's why she eats
thirty-cent suppers.  And when I think how I came along,
and just took care of her and helped her all I could, not knowing,
I could just sing!  You see those dresses Ruth has got?  I
bought them all for her; she had only&mdash;sort of plain little
things, and not enough.  They had to be washed out.  Makes
me so mad to think about it."
</p>

<p>
"But, Martha, how&mdash;how did you find this out?"
</p>

<p>
"She <i>told</i> me herself.  You see&mdash;she wouldn't say what she
was going to do when her school was out, at first.  She sort
of hung off&mdash;she wouldn't say who was coming into the flat,
or when she'd rented it for.  Then when I insisted on staying&mdash;the
other girls were leaving&mdash;she said she wanted to keep it a
few days, because she was having company from the country.
I knew she was tired out, so I said I'd help her entertain them.
I'd drive them around.  But she didn't want me to.  I thought,
maybe, they were&mdash;sort of funny country people, or something.
And, anyway, she didn't intend having any real vacation.  She
said she was going to spend her vacation with her sister, whose
husband has T.B. of the bones, and she has a whole family
of children, and she does her own washing and everything.
Miss Curtis was going to take care of that man sick in bed,
and of the kids, and give her sister a rest.  That's just like her,
mother.  And I just put my foot down and said she had to
come here and have a few days' rest herself first.  And then
she hummed and hawed, and said her niece wanted to come
and see Chicago.  And then, when all the girls were gone, she
told me.  She said, 'She's my very own child, Martha.'  Just
like that!  I'd begun to suspect something funny by that time;
and even then I thought maybe she had adopted her or something.
I couldn't believe it.  How could I believe that of a
woman like Miss Curtis?  And then, mammie, I wish you'd
have seen those two when Ruth got there.  They just sat down
together and cried for joy!  You know me, mammie; I'm not
sentimental, but I went into my room and cried my eyes out
when I remembered how they looked at each other!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, of all things!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!  To <i>think</i> that I found her!  She said once to me
that she'd lived in that flat with students for six years, and
she'd never let anybody share her meals with her but me.  She
doesn't make friends easily&mdash;naturally.  We understood each
other; I didn't know why, of course!  And I suppose the reason
she talked to me about all her relations so much was so I
wouldn't suspect she was hiding anything!  Think what she's
been through, mammie!  Ruth doesn't live near her people, you
know.  They're in Iowa.  They must know about her, of
course, but apparently she doesn't take Ruth to them.  She
just goes out there to see her, or takes her some place.  And,
mammie, that family that keep her, they love her; they want to
adopt her; they do everything for her.  Miss Curtis won't be
jealous of them, but they have her nearly all the time.  My
God!  Mammie, when I think of it!  She can always come
here, can't she, mammie?  We can be friends to her, mammie!"  And
when Martha turned to her mother her eyes were swimming
with tears.  "Think of that child's future!  Isn't she a
sweet little thing?  She doesn't do very well in school; she's
so happy, she's lazy.  Miss Curtis says she absolutely refused
to bring her here until I told her Mrs. Bissel and May had
gone to the lakes."
</p>

<p>
"Of course she can come here!  We'll make a home for
Ruth here!"
</p>

<p>
"But we can't do much, mammie.  Miss Curtis is so independent,
I can hardly manage her.  You see, she won't accept
anything from me, hardly.  But she can't refuse to let me get
Ruth things.  I got her that doll, of course.  I'd like to get
hold of that child's father a little while!  I bet I'd put the fear
of God into him!  Mammie, I can't tell you how worked up I've
been over this, this last week.  When I look at that woman, I
just sort of shiver with admiration.  She breaks me up so.
Isn't she sporting?  Isn't she a brick?  Look what she is and
what she's been through!  I look at her and wonder if there's
anything in the world a woman can't do!  And like as not the
school board will find it all out, some day, and fire her!  I'm
never going to lose track of that child; I'm going to keep
friends with her!  Mammie, I've been&mdash;excited all week!  I
had to tell you!  It seems too strange!"
</p>

<p>
"It does seem too strange," Emily repeated.
</p>

<p>
"By heck! what a novel I'm going to write!  This&mdash;sets
me up; this eggs me on so!  I'm going to change a lot of it;
I'm going to make it hotter!"
</p>

<p>
"Does Miss Curtis know about the novel?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  She knows I'm writing it; but she doesn't know why."
</p>

<p>
Emily marveled; she kept on marveling.  She was as
excited as Martha was the next few days.  She had to keep
from looking at Miss Curtis too intently; that woman had
become almost too poignantly interesting.  It was as if she
was living Emily Kenworthy's life and Martha's.  It seemed
impossible to believe Martha's story.  Miss Curtis was
unromantic, so dull, so sensible.  She seemed almost stupidly
passionless&mdash;except when the child came running to her.  And
when Emily saw her draw little Ruth to herself, and push her
fringe of hair away from her forehead, and look at her, she
had to believe that Martha had stumbled upon the truth of
the situation.  The woman, undoubtedly, was maternity itself.
Had she some way guessed what Martha had been through,
and told her this secret for some unselfish purpose?  Could she
have loved some one beyond all reason?  How had she managed
to hide her shame?  How had she endured the pity and
the jeerings of the secure and holy?  Emily found herself in
Martha's state.  She quivered with curiosity and reverence, and
a desire to befriend those two.  Could that woman be living
in fear that some day when her secret would become known,
she would be without a means of earning her living?  "I must
pretend not to be very much interested in her!" Emily kept
saying.  But she understood why Martha had felt so lifted up
by her discovery.

<i>Chapter Nine</i>
</h3>

<p>
Mrs. Benton stepped in for a minute one afternoon, on
her way home.  "Where's Bob?" she asked, cautiously.
</p>

<p>
"He's gone downtown."
</p>

<p>
"I just thought I'd tell you about Johnnie.  He's going to
be home in about three weeks, I think, or maybe four.  So
it would have to come out, anyway.  Do you know what he's
doing this summer?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  You didn't tell me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, he got a job as a steward on a boat going to South
America; a steward, Emily.  Carrying coffee around on a little
tray; and from there he went to Hong-Kong on some sort of
a ship."
</p>

<p>
"Goodness!  What a lot of the world he's seeing!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; carrying coffee into women's staterooms, and they
won't have their hair combed!"
</p>

<p>
"Still, he's seeing the world!  How did he get the job?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know.  Went with some of his boon companions
to New York, and there was a strike, and they just got jobs
and went away.  He didn't wait to ask my advice, of course."
</p>

<p>
Emily hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"What's he planning to do next year?"
</p>

<p>
"He won't be planning anything.  I'm planning to have him
go back and get his degree.  I'm going to my sister's for a
little rest before he gets home."
</p>

<p>
"You haven't been away at all all summer."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if I'm going to manage the beach, I've got to be on
the job.  You haven't been away, either."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't think of leaving Bob."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Benton's glance spoke disagreeing volumes.
</p>

<p>
A month later, Emily met Johnnie with his mother coming
out of the post office.  Just the same old Johnnie, happy-go-lucky
and careless, grinning and frank.  The Orient had conferred
upon him no subtlety, Spanish America had taught him
no guile.  A small chance they had had, to be sure.  A longer
one would have been as ineffective.  He came to see Emily
that same day.  She looked at him curiously, envying him his
experience.  To have smelled China! to have blinked at Brazil!
</p>

<p>
All he said was: "Sure I had a good time; I earned my own
living, anyway.  And there's no garbage can in the world I
can't eat out of now, after what I lived on across the Pacific.
When's Martha to be home?"
</p>

<p>
Emily didn't know.  She gave him, rather reluctantly, her
address.
</p>

<p>
He drove up to Chicago the next day, in the new car his
mother had ordered as soon as he left Hong-Kong for San
Francisco.  Cora Benton said he had gone to see Martha, she
felt sure, because he refused to take her with him.  But
what happened when their children met neither mother knew.
Presently Johnnie went back East to college, driving the new
car.  Mrs. Benton said she really didn't need it.  She wasn't
well, and she was going to California early, for all the winter.
Her tone implied that the town would just have to worry along
without her as best it might.  She hated, she said, having the
children's Christmas party in the hall fall through.
</p>

<p>
Emily was drawing all the comfort about her that she could
get from the fact that she was still, at any rate, with Miss
Curtis, when Martha wrote that she had left her flat.  She had
got a better place in the apartment of a woman doctor in the
neighborhood.  The announcement upset whatever peace of
mind Emily had achieved.  Could Martha have quarreled with
her friend?  A woman doctor, Emily would have thought, was
the last person she would have taken up with.  There came a
dull day when she said to herself that she didn't care whether
Martha wanted her or not, she was going to Chicago to see
where she was living.
</p>

<p>
But in the train her heart grew heavier.  Martha had said
distinctly that she had no room for company.  She must have
written that to warn her mother not to come investigating.
This doctor person wasn't one you could just disturb.  So
Emily shopped all the afternoon, dispiritedly.  Once she tried
in vain to get Martha by 'phone.  She sat in Field's tea-room an
hour, determined not to go back home without seeing her
child, yet dreading to find herself unwelcome.  That would be
more than she could endure.  She felt tears coming into her
eyes, at length.  "I can't stay here and make a fool of myself!"
she thought, angrily.  She went down to the street into the
darkness and got into a taxicab.  And, after a long time, during
which Emily commanded herself repeatedly not to be silly, the
taxi stopped in front of a very smart new apartment house.
</p>

<p>
Emily announced herself up the speaking tube meekly, half
expecting a rebuff.  "This is Martha Kenworthy's mother.
Is Martha in?"
</p>

<p>
"Ho!" cried an exuberant voice in surprise.  "Wait a
moment!"
</p>

<p>
Some one was running down the stairs to show her the way
up.  Emily was conscious of a richly carpeted hall, a large gay
room, a stunning seal-brown frock on a woman as large as
herself, with a fine head, a high color, a heart-warming sort
of person of great vitality.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Kenworthy!  Do come in!  I know all about you.
Sit down.  I'm Isobel Stevenson.  No, Martha isn't here just
now; I'll 'phone her.  She's getting dinner at Miss Curtis's.
I am glad to see you; I've been curious about you, after all I've
heard."
</p>

<p>
She picked up the 'phone from a desk in the room, asked for
the number without looking it up, and went on talking all the
time she waited for her connection.
</p>

<p>
"Jennie Curtis told me all about you, of course, about your
husband and the garden.  I'd like to take her home for week-ends
myself, but it's too far.  She doesn't stand driving
well.&mdash;Hello, Martha!  Your mother's here....  I said your
mother....  Why didn't you tell me she was coming? ... Never mind,
drop it.  Come on over....  Well, come and have supper with
me.  Tell Jennie to come....  Of course she'll come.  Tell her
I said she was to come....  Leave a note for her, then....
Oh, put them in water and let them stand till to-morrow; or
bring them along and cook them here....  She told me Martha
bought that car just to take her out home with.  That's some
girl of yours, Mrs. Kenworthy.  Of course, Jennie Curtis is
pure gold, but you don't often get a girl of Martha's age who
knows gold when she sees it.  She came over the other day
and asked me to take Martha in till my friend comes back."  She
had seated herself near Emily, who had not had a chance
to say one word.  She pointed now with a large gesture at
the pictures on the walls, the interesting-looking things which
Emily had only vaguely realized were about her.  "I live here
with a friend who travels a great deal.  All these things are
hers, really.  So I took her in, just to please Jennie.  And I
must say I like her.  She's an awfully nice girl for her age.
I find her companionable.  But tell me, Mrs. Kenworthy&mdash;there
isn't much time; she'll be here in a minute&mdash;hasn't she
had some sort of affair, some disappointment, or something?"
</p>

<p>
The fact that she paused for an answer was as surprising
as the question she had asked, professionally, as it were.  Her
praise of Martha, her vigor, the richness of the setting, her
friendliness, all of it was so contrary to Emily's mood and
expectations that she was overwhelmed.  She felt tears coming
into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes!" she cried.  "And you're a doctor.  Do something
for her.  She's been through&mdash;terrible things; she's so young!"
</p>

<p>
"I knew it!" said the doctor, complacently.  "I knew it the
first time I really talked to her.  But she's getting over it; she
don't need any help; she's got stuff in her.  Don't you worry."
</p>

<p>
"No," murmured Emily, "I'm not worried, of course.  I&mdash;I'm
tired, I guess.  I&mdash;can't&mdash;I&mdash;may I go and wash my face?
I don't know what made me&mdash;do this."
</p>

<p>
Emily was shown into Martha's bedroom.  A white-tiled
bath opened off it.  No comfort was lacking in that bedroom,
which seemed to have aspired originally to feminine austerity.
Martha's familiar things made it homelike.  And in that room
Martha found her mother, before Emily had had time to
powder her nose.
</p>

<p>
Martha's greeting was warmer because of those tears.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth's the matter, mammie?" she said, hugging
her.  "Why didn't you let me know you were coming?  You've
been crying!  What's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
Emily's impulse was to shout out the truth.  "I've been so
lonely for you, so worried about you!" But she said, instead:
"Oh, nothing's wrong.  I just got&mdash;bored.  I&mdash;just felt&mdash;I
couldn't stay in that house a minute longer!  I just had to get
away or shriek."  Emily had heard women say things like that.
Unwittingly she had touched Martha deeply.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you poor old thing!  I always knew you must feel
that way, living with&mdash;in that house.  But you'd never
acknowledge it.  How did you find this place?  Quite an apartment,
isn't it?  I was sick of a rooming house!  Have you seen the
doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"She seemed pleased, didn't you think so?  She didn't look
annoyed.  I was told I couldn't have company here.  It isn't
often&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The doctor was there with them.
</p>

<p>
"We're going to have a spread, Martha!  The maid's out.
You go and get the lettuce, get two heads, get good ones; and
some whipping cream; and some bronze chrysanthemums.  Oh,
it's no trouble, Mrs. Kenworthy!  I feel just like it to-day.
The time and place and the loved ones to bother.  If you can't
get the chrysanthemums, get some&mdash;something that color.  And
hurry back."
</p>

<p>
The doctor had on a white apron, and the kitchen had made
her cheeks rosier.  She set Emily down to rest for a little in
the interesting living room.  Miss Curtis came in, and was
ordered to sit and talk to her.  But every minute or two the
doctor came in from the kitchen, and with her a flood and
whirlpool of words.  Emily scarcely had a chance to say a
word all that evening; but the house excited her until her color
was almost as bright as the doctor's.
</p>

<p>
Everything on the dining table was like the hostess.  The
table mats were of a strong and superior unbleached linen; the
vivid dishes called aloud for admiration; the candle-light was
flattering.  Emily sat excitedly studying the doctor.  Whoever
put herself into that woman's care would never afterwards
dare to call either body or soul her own.  But if she was
high handed, she was also high hearted.  She talked almost
without ceasing; and whatever little thing she talked of, she
enjoyed so merrily that the three women watching her, shared
her delight to some extent.  And when she laughed a hearty
laugh, every time Emily thought surprisedly: "What a good
time I'm having!  This is the best possible place for Martha!"
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever taste any sort of canned meat as good as
this chicken in your life?  Lobster simply isn't in it!  It's
fatted calf for me.  My mother keeps me in it; but I never
open a jar when I'm alone; I'm not <i>that</i> selfish, anyway.
Cold pack, of course, as you know, Mrs. Kenworthy.  We had
a family scrap about it the last time I went home.  My sister
Isobel&mdash;she's an awful woman as far as she can manage to
be&mdash;she said to me, 'Now look here, Isobel' (she's always
trying to boss me around), 'you can just find a deadly germ in
canned chicken.  I'm not going to have mother worried to
death canning chicken for you to guzzle any longer.  She's
too old, and so are you.  You can just tell her you've got
poisoned by it and you aren't going to eat it any longer.'  'I'll
be damned if I'll find a deadly germ in it,' I told her.  'If you
don't want mother doing it for me, you can do it yourself.'  After
all you can't just stand your relations imposing on you
forever, can you?  Not if you have as many as I have!  I
just made an announcement then and there.  My fees for
removing appendices are canned fat chicken, and those
strawberry preserves they make in the sun so they keep the right
color of red.  I'm not going to eat city chickens that have been
shut up in a little coop on Fifty-seventh Street.  I want
contented hens that have crowed in the barns I have played in.
Nice sunny barn doors!  Don't you love barn doors on spring
days when all the hens are cackling?  What do I practically
keep a bed in the Presbyterian Hospital full of my fifty-two
first cousins for, anyway, if I have to eat canned salmon on
occasions of haste?  There are limits to my patience.  What
are you snickering at, Martha?  That's not a pun!"
</p>

<p>
With such banalities she kept them aroused, expectant.
There was no constraint; no one of the three was thinking of
something amusing to say; each knew very well she would have
no chance to say anything amusing, however well prepared she
might be.  The doctor never ceased for a minute.
</p>

<p>
Finally she folded up her tongue for the night and left
them together there.
</p>

<p>
"Is she always like that?" Emily murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, I don't think so.  I don't know her very well.  I
never had a meal here before.  You've made a hit with her,
mammie!  She sort of owns Miss Curtis.  Maybe she took
care of her through&mdash;THAT&mdash;or something.  Anyway, Miss
Curtis told her about you, and that's why she asked you to stay
here.  Of course, she just took me in because Miss Curtis has
been fussing about me studying in the kitchen ever since she
saw our house.  She's made up her mind&mdash;the doctor has&mdash;that
Miss Curtis has got to put those girls out, when she can,
because they're so thoughtless about her, and everything, and
that I'm to have those front rooms and do them over to suit
myself.  She bosses everybody around.  I guess she thinks
she's got a lot more sense than most people, and so she ought
to tell them where to get off.  You can see why she's got such
a practice.  Can't you just see her sailing into somebody's
sick-room with her tail up, that way, and making them wild
to get up and be strong as a horse, like she is?  Miss Curtis
says she's the only woman who ever got through medical school
and got a practice without losing her color.  She doesn't pay
very much attention to me.  She's busy, 'most always.  Sometimes
she gets to talking about some interesting case, and goes
on half the night.  I never get a word in edgewise.  I just
listen."
</p>

<p>
Emily, as she lay waiting for sleep, said to herself: "Well,
if horrible things happen to us when we don't expect them,
so do lovely things.  If I'd searched this city over for two
friends for Martha, I'd never have found any equal to these
two.  The doctor's just a clean gale blowing through Martha.
She'll clean out her mind; she'll do for her what I never could.
Why should I want to do everything in the world that's done for
her?  Why can't I be satisfied to see those women helping her
along?"
</p>

<p>
She went back to her home more happy about Martha than
she had been for months.  Mrs. Benton had already gone East
and it promised to be a quiet winter for club-women in general
The one great event of it was to be the annual Christmas party
for children.  Mrs. Benton had instituted the custom the winter
before, the first year of the new dance hall.  She had given a
splendid party that once.  She left a committee behind her to
try to follow her example.
</p>

<p>
They were discussing it at lunch.  Emily had realized that
the women across from her were talking about ways of finding
good jobs for girls who had to leave high school, when
Mrs. Bissel leaned across towards her and asked:
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Kenworthy, by the way, what's this new job Martha's
got?  What's she planning to do?"
</p>

<p>
There were four women who might be supposed to be listening
in that pause with more or less curiosity for Emily's reply.
</p>

<p>
She had heard nothing of Martha's job.  She smiled.  "Oh,
I don't know," she replied, lightly.  "I don't think it's
anything very&mdash;purposeful."
</p>

<p>
"But do you approve of her leaving the university to take
it up?"
</p>

<p>
Emily had heard not a hint of Martha leaving the university.
She must have left in the middle of a quarter.
</p>

<p>
She said, "Not altogether."  She shrugged her shoulders.
"I'm afraid her heart's never really been in the university.
I wish she could have gone on, in her own college, with her
own class.  But I do think girls of her age have to decide
these things for themselves."
</p>

<p>
She left the meeting early.  She had a notion to go straight
to Chicago.  What job could Martha possibly have got?  And
why?  And had she left her two good friends?  And did she
mean deliberately to hurt her mother's feelings by having her
learn this through Mrs. Bissel?  "Perhaps," thought Emily,
longingly, "she's taking somebody's place for a few weeks.
Perhaps just at Christmas; perhaps the doctor's office girl has
got ill, or something.  I expect she's helping some one.  And
she's been too busy to write.  I ought to do some Christmas
shopping.  I'll go up to-morrow and 'phone her, at least.  I'll
see for myself what's she into."
</p>

<p>
And after supper Martha called her by 'phone.  The connection
was poor.  Some operator had to relay the unsatisfactory
message.  All that Emily understood was that Martha
would meet her for tea the next day at the usual place.
</p>

<p>
But the next afternoon Martha led her to a new-found tea-room
in an office building&mdash;a remote place, one secure corner
of which the two of them had quite to themselves.  Emily had
to feel her way towards her daughter carefully, for she saw at
once that Martha was in an evil mood.  Around her eyes were
the hollows and shadows of tears.
</p>

<p>
She began directly: "I got a job; I didn't write you&mdash;because
I've been too blue.  I've just felt like crying my eyes out
every minute the last week.  I just had to 'phone you.  I knew
I ought to tell you; I just thought I couldn't write.  I'm
working in a shop; it's a classy place, believe me.  Interior
decorators, on Mich. Boul."
</p>

<p>
"Do you like it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm not mad about it by any means.  It'll do."
</p>

<p>
"You go to your lectures still at the U?  You don't stay in
this shop all day?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I'm done with that place.  I'm going to smoke.  You
needn't make a fuss; everyone's used to it here."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps this will be better than writing away on a novel,"
Emily was thinking.  She didn't want to seem to look too
inquisitively at Martha.  She played about with her tea; she
called Martha's attention to the couple who had entered.  "Why
is it," she asked, to break the silence, "that the more expensive
the fur coat, the fatter the woman inside it?"
</p>

<p>
But Martha broke forth abruptly, "I've burned my novel up!"
</p>

<p>
Emily was sharply stung by the bitterness of that confession.
She had always wanted that novel burned up, but she hadn't
wanted Martha to be so hurt by its destruction.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Martie?  What did you do that for?"
</p>

<p>
"I needn't have been so hasty!  I've got most of it&mdash;in rough
form.  I could put it all together again; but it would be an
awful lot of work."
</p>

<p>
"You worked on it nearly a year."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I had.  And if I'd known everything <i>then</i> I know
<i>now</i>, I wouldn't have burned it up, you can bet!  I typed it
all over without a mistake, from beginning to end; it had
seventy thousand words."
</p>

<p>
"Goodness!" Emily murmured, impressed.
</p>

<p>
"And I couldn't hardly sleep, I was so anxious to see what
that old idiot of a prof. would think of it.  I might have
known, handing it in to an old rake of a man!"
</p>

<p>
Emily let her go on unreproved.
</p>

<p>
"And it was the funniest thing!  I just <i>happened</i> to find out
what he meant.  You hand your work in, mammie, and then you
go and have a consultation with the prof. about it.  Well, I'd
never had any old consultation before.  And everybody says he
is a horrid man; to women, especially.  He don't think women
can write novels, of course.  He thinks it's his business to
discourage them.  I was scared out of my wits to go and talk to
him about my novel, to tell the truth.  I might have known
something was wrong, for he was as nice to me as you please.
He was surprised to see me when I came in.  He didn't know me
from Adam, before, of course.  I suppose he thought I'd be
foaming at the mouth, or something.  He jollied me along,
the oily old rake; said my work was interesting and everything;
that I'd put a lot of work in on it.  And then he said: 'You
know sometimes we think it well&mdash;to refer these themes to
other departments.  The last one before you,' he said, all
smooth and gentle, 'I referred to the biologist under whom
the student works.  And I had yours read by Doctor Parson,
Doctor Edith Parson; she is more able than I am&mdash;to judge
of the worth of this material,' he said.  'So I had her read it
over, and I suggest you go and consult her first, and then come
and talk it over with me.'  All hemming and hawing, he was,
the flea.  So I swallowed it all.  I didn't know any better.  I
knew they did send theses and things for grad. degrees around
to a lot of profs.  I asked somebody there waiting to see him,
a girl from the class, who this Doctor Parson was, but she
didn't know.  So then, mammie, I went home.  This was a
week ago last Thursday.  I was in Doctor Stevenson's living
room that evening, and I naturally asked her if she knew who
Doctor Parson was.  I didn't tell her WHY I was asking, or
anything.  And, mammie, what do you think she said!"
</p>

<p>
Tears came flooding into Martha's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What difference does it make what she said, child!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it may not make any difference to YOU, but it did to
ME.  'I know her,' she said, and she smiled sort of funny.
So I said, 'Who is she?'  And she said, 'Oh, every little while
some crazy woman gets into the U, and Doctor Parson is the
one that gets them into the asylum.  I had to help her once,
one summer.  She called me in because I was near and
strong.'"  And suddenly Martha turned away, shuddering in
uncontrollable repulsion.  She covered her face with her hands,
just for a second, and went on:
</p>

<p>
"I had to sit there, mammie, not saying a word to give
myself away, and take it all.  She said that woman&mdash;the one
that went crazy&mdash;she wanted to go right out in the street
without any clothes on, and everything.  I thought she'd never get
through talking.  They had to have three policemen that night.
I thought I'd just die, I was so scared.  And I got away from
her as soon as I could, and I got the novel and went right down
to the janitor and asked him to let me put something into the
furnace.  So he did, and I saw it burning.  I saw it all curling
up burned.  And then I went and stayed with Miss Curtis.
She let me have a bed in her room; she was just sweet to me,
mammie.  I told her I was sick.  She wanted me to go home;
she said I needed a rest."
</p>

<p>
"Martha, you <i>do</i> need a rest, my dear.  You've worked so
steadily.  Why don't you come home with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Mammie&mdash;no.  I went and got a job.  I had&mdash;to have
something&mdash;else to think about.  I couldn't go home; I couldn't bear
to go back to the doctor's.  I stayed with Miss Curtis for more
than a week."
</p>

<p>
"And now?  Where are you now?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm back at the doctor's, all right now.  I'm not a bit
more&mdash;out of my head than she is, anyway.  It doesn't always
follow that if a girl&mdash;or a woman&mdash;falls in love, as they say,
that she's crazy.  Look at that Doctor Stevenson.  Wouldn't
you say she was sane, mammie?  Wouldn't you say that if
anybody in the world is in her right mind, it's that woman?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I would certainly call her a well-balanced woman."
</p>

<p>
"Well!" cried Martha, triumphantly.  "You say <i>she's</i> sane,
and she keeps a lover&mdash;there&mdash;in that apartment&mdash;all the time!"
</p>

<p>
"Martha!  You mustn't say that!  Not so loud!"  Emily
looked around her hurriedly.  "You must not say things like
that&mdash;gossip, like that!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not repeating any gossip.  You needn't get so excited.
I'm not telling anybody but you, and I saw it with my own
eyes."
</p>

<p>
Emily said, sharply, "I don't believe you know what you're
talking about."
</p>

<p>
"I know <i>exactly</i> what I'm talking about!  She told me when
I went to live with her that she had a friend that came to stay
with her, and that when that friend came I had to clear out.
Naturally, when a single woman says a friend is coming to
stay with her, you suppose it's a woman.  But it isn't.  It's a
man.  I saw him!"
</p>

<p>
"When?  How?"  Emily was intent upon refuting this mistake.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he comes for Saturday and Sunday, and I had been
staying all week with Miss Curtis.  And, anyway, they always
go to the concert Saturday night.  I had to go and get some
underwear out of my room.  I thought they would be at the
concert, so I went in."
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, she heard me opening the door with my key, and
she called to me: 'Martha, is that you?  Come in here!' she
said to me.  And I went into her living room; and there was
that man.  A great big, tall man, walking around with his
hands in his pockets.  She was sitting at her desk, pretending
to be looking at an account book.  'This is my brother,' she
said to me.  And he never took his hands out of his pockets.
He said to me, growling, 'I am <i>not</i> her brother!' just like
that.  And she said, 'Oh, all right, then, you aren't.  You aren't
any relation to me!'  You know how she thinks she can carry
anything off, that way.  Of course I felt terribly embarrassed.
I just got my stuff and fled.  That man was staying in my
bedroom.  His things were there.  Did you ever hear anything
like that in your life, mother?  The nerve of her!  With all
that practice, and everybody thinking she's so respectable!
Nobody thinks <i>she's</i> crazy.  I'm glad I didn't burn up the first
copy of my book."
</p>

<p>
"But, Martha, look here!  That doesn't prove that he's&mdash;that
doesn't prove anything."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you fool yourself!  I saw the man; I saw his face.
You can't tell me what a man means when he looks like that.
And, anyway, Miss Curtis saw me coming in.  I bet she's in
cahoots with her!  She said, 'You haven't been at the doctor's,
have you?' like that, sort of excited.  I said: 'Yes, I have.
I thought she would have been at the concert.'  She said, 'You
oughtn't to have gone there when she has company.'  And she
didn't know whether to go on and say any more to me, or not.
But she didn't.  So now I stay there, just as I always did.  If
I'm mad, she's mad."
</p>

<p>
"But you're just silly.  I don't think either of you is the
least speck insane!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what did that oily old bird send me to that&mdash;woman
for then?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  Maybe she was a psychologist&mdash;or a&mdash;a
psychoanalyst, or something.  What was in the novel?  You
must be reasonable, Martha.  The university isn't keeping a
woman just to send students to asylums.  She has something
else to do, surely?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think she has; not for a minute!  If you'd seen that
campus, you'd think it kept a dozen specialists to weed out the
nuts.  And, anyway, why did that prof. act so sort of gentle
to me?  Why did he ask me so carefully if I was Martha Kenworthy,
as if he couldn't believe I was?  Anyway, I'll tell you
one thing, mammie; if the doctor can keep a lover and a practice
in the same apartment, I should hope I can learn interior
decoration without anybody saying anything to me!  Just
imagine if anybody tried to make things uncomfortable for the
doctor; wouldn't she tell them where to get off, though!  If
she can put that across, why can't I?"
</p>

<p>
"Martha, really, I don't believe this.  She doesn't look like
that sort of woman."
</p>

<p>
"Well, of COURSE she doesn't!  That's the whole point!
Look at the women that go parading around Hyde Park.  None
of them look it; neither do I, for that matter.  I don't suppose
there's one of them that's any better than I am; and they're
not making any fuss about what's happened!  I can be as
hardboiled as any of them; I can put on holy airs with the rest
of them; I'm understudying the doctor!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, my opinion is that you're both of you good women
and useful women, and you don't need to put on airs!"
</p>

<p>
"But you'll never understand either of us, if you do mean
well; you're too good, that's what's the matter with you.  That's
why I feel&mdash;so much more at home&mdash;with Miss Curtis, and
the doctor, especially the doctor.  Honestly, you can't imagine
how blue I was.  I wanted to&mdash;well, I didn't know&mdash;whatever
I was going to do, but this bucked me up.  Imagine, mammie!
I'd like to see a doctor like Doctor Stevenson, only more
so&mdash;the best surgeon in Chicago&mdash;so that people would just HAVE
to have her operate to save them; and then I wish she'd just
go on living with all the men she wanted to&mdash;and snap her
finger at the whole bunch of them.  I'm going into business.
The doctor said for me not to invest a cent with the boss; she
was the one that looked him up, and found he'd failed in New
York.  I told her I hadn't any capital of my own, and I don't
give a damn what anybody suspects me of!"
</p>

<p>
Martha was wearing long thin jade earrings, and she gave
her head a little jerk as she announced her intentions.  She
had on a green hat, of a hard color.  Could it be just the
shadow of that green over her eyes that made them seem
ringed and bitter?
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well.  But how about Christmas?  You'll have a
few days off, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't have any.  I'm going into this business.  I've
got to stick at it.  Look here, mammie, if you'll stay for dinner,
I'll get Mrs. Blacksley from my shop to meet us some place.  I
didn't want to take you to the shop, for I knew her husband
was to have dinner with us.  He's an idiot, but she's all right.  I
get along with her; she's divorced one husband.  If she'd
consult me, I'd tell her to divorce another."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Blacksley, Martha said, seldom spent even thirty cents
on her dinner.  For that reason they awaited her in the Drake
Café, and planned to nourish her weariness with a thick rich
dinner, and beefsteaks were the one thing you could get better
in Chicago than anywhere else in the world, Martha declared,
ignoring magnificently her inexperience in most other places
in the world.  Mrs. Blacksley joined them there.
</p>

<p>
She joined them languidly, softly.  She threw off a short
black fur coat, and a little black hat, carelessly, as if all the
other women in the crowded room were sitting bareheaded.
She stood up for a moment, regardless perhaps of the attention
she was attracting.  She had on a little soft black wool frock,
full skirted, with the waist fitted cunningly over her delicate
breast.  It was a right little frock; it was a bit too devilishly
right for her.
</p>

<p>
It made Emily think, even as Mrs. Blacksley chose to sit
with her back to the room: "Well, if what helps Martha in
her friends is a scandalous past or a compromising present,
this woman is going to be very useful to her."  Nothing less
like those utilitarian mentors of Hyde Park could a girl have
happened upon.  Mrs. Blacksley was still young&mdash;but her eyes
had a past.  Her lips had a history; her smooth hair, drawn
back so severely from those beautiful temples, so cleverly from
those little ears, had a beguiling present challenge.  Surely,
for fifty generations, those gray eyes had been looking cynically
at eager lovers.  Her mouth was soft and lovely; lips like
hers must have kissed only with mental reservations for
centuries.  She was exotic, she was alluring.  She had divorced
one husband, had she?  She aroused a question then,
immediately.  How many men had wanted to be her second?
</p>

<p>
She said to Martha, later, as they were going together to
her train&mdash;she spoke suddenly, struck by an interesting
thought:
</p>

<p>
"Look here, isn't the doctor's name Isobel?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, but Martha, she said her sister's name was Isobel."
</p>

<p>
"Did she?  I didn't notice."
</p>

<p>
"I did!  She did say her sister's name was Isobel!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what of it?"  Martha was curious.
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't you see, there couldn't be two Isobels in one
family?  They must be half-sisters, or step sisters, or
something.  Maybe that man WAS a brother&mdash;of some kind."
</p>

<p>
Then Martha laughed.  She laughed just like Mrs. Blacksley,
softly, jeeringly.
</p>

<p>
"You're the limit, mammie!"  She laughed again, more
naturally, from sheer amusement.  "You can't believe what I
say, can you?  You're too good for this world, mammie!  The
doctor'll take care of herself.  Don't you worry about her!"
</p>

<p>
"You can laugh at me, if you want to; but I don't believe it.
Anyway, why shouldn't a woman doctor have a man patient,
if she wants one?"
</p>

<p>
"To be sure!" agreed Martha, "if she wants one," she added,
in another tone.  "I don't admire her taste; but I'm willing
to let her have as many as she wants."

<h3>
<i>Chapter Ten</i>
</h3>

<p>
"Do a deed," they say, "and make a proverb."  But why,
Emily mused more than once, should Martha, having done but
one deed, go on making proverbs indefinitely.  Must she
interpret life forever by that one bitter mistake of hers?  The
more Emily thought of the doctor, the more deeply she was
convinced that Martha was mistaken about her lover.  She
would have been a magnificent mother of a family of rollicking
boys.  Was it likely that a hard-headed professional woman,
with a practice to maintain, was going to entangle herself with
awkward amorous relationships?  Emily decided it was not.
</p>

<p>
It was possible, too, that Martha had misunderstood Miss
Curtis.  Emily longed to prove it.  She wanted to go and ask
Mrs. Bissel all she knew of Miss Curtis's history.  If a woman
as conventional as Mrs. Bissel knew anything of that discrediting
sort, would she have allowed her daughter to live in her flat?
Certainly not, Emily said to herself.  But just suppose Martha
could be right?  The least possibility of such a thing made it
out of the question for Emily to broach the gossipy subject to
Mrs. Bissel.  So she held her tongue.
</p>

<p>
Then Martha walked in one snowy morning, like a normal
child, home for the holidays, happy to be home.  She walked in
unannounced, alone, undefended by any stranger from intimacy
with her mother!  She walked in and she gave Emily a
hug&mdash;an old little-girl hug, the like of which she had not had,
since&mdash;THAT happened.  Emily's neck could scarcely believe
the feeling of those arms about it.  Emily's eyes had to blink.
Here now was that first little old Martha, the dear one that
had been away from her for so long.  Martha had recovered
her real self; she was looking better; she was looking&mdash;bright,
again; she was looking&mdash;excited.  Yes, that was the word;
she was excited through and through.  Could she have fallen
in love?  Alas! that was too much to hope for.  When she
went upstairs Emily stood and listened.  She half expected her
to walk into the painted room.
</p>

<p>
She went into the guest room, however.  She wasn't quite
completely a daughter yet, then.
</p>

<p>
When she came down and saw Maggie's condition, she took
the preparations for dinner out of her hands.  The kitchen,
some way, seemed to belong to Martha.  Even Maggie, who
had never relinquished it to Emily for a second, seemed
conscious that it had changed owners.  Emily stood about, talking
to her.
</p>

<p>
"What," Martha cried, "the costumes aren't made!  They
haven't rehearsed for a month!  Why didn't you write to me,
mammie?  I'd have come to help you."
</p>

<p>
Had she forgotten how shortly she had refused to come
home at all for Christmas?  Was she offering now, really, to
plunge into the affairs of this town whose very existence she
seemed of late to have resented?
</p>

<p>
"I'll go and get them.  Let's have a seamstress to come here,
and have a bee, and get them all done.  I'll bet Miss Trent
would train the children, mammie.  She loathes Mrs. Benton."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't talk that way, Martie!"
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!" Martha derided, making faces.
"That's what you mean, really.  Only you don't say it.  You
know you don't want to fall down now&mdash;just because of what
Mrs. Benton would say!  I'd like to show her a thing or two
myself.  I bet I could get a dozen women into this, who'd work
just for spite!"
</p>

<p>
"That's not a nice way to work!"
</p>

<p>
"But it cooks the hash, mammie!"
</p>

<p>
Martha chuckled toward her mother.  She kept repeating
it&mdash;that new gesture toward her.  A perplexing sort of amused
understanding of her mother kept shining out of her eyes all
the time she sat at dinner, talking to her father.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she had washed the dishes she took the car
and set forth twinkling to rally workers.  She came back about
five with two suit cases full of cut or basted costumes.  These
she deposited on the floor of the living room, and proceeded
to examine them, talking all the time of her success.  White
wings she shook out, and curious red calico legs she unfolded.
Emily was sitting on the sofa.  And Martha was standing by
the living-room table&mdash;where she had stood, exactly, when
she announced, "Richard Quin is getting a divorce."  She bent
down and lifted up a cerise crinoline sort of wide ruche.
</p>

<p>
"Now, what do you make of this, mammie?  This must be
for a villain!"  And she put it around her neck&mdash;it had no
fastening, yet&mdash;and holding it tightly together, she danced
across the room, and looked at herself absurdly in a mirror.
</p>

<p>
"Believe me, mammie, this is going to be a play!"
</p>

<p>
Her manner was so triumphant, that Emily was overcome by
her impulse.
</p>

<p>
"Martha!" she exclaimed, "What HAS happened to you?
What's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
The girl faced about abruptly.  She stared intently at her
mother.  And as she looked her face changed.  It lost that
new expression of admiration with which she had warmed her
mother's heart all day.  And when she spoke her voice was
almost bitter.
</p>

<p>
"Well, YOU'RE a nice one to ask me that!"
</p>

<p>
"Why am I a nice one?  What have I done now?"
</p>

<p>
Martha spoke with an effort.  "I suppose it doesn't matter;
or you think it doesn't matter.  I suppose you did what you
thought best for me.  I'm not judging you, but it would have
made things a great deal easier for me if you could have told
me the truth."
</p>

<p>
"The truth about what?"
</p>

<p>
Martha was annoyed by the question.  She hesitated, but
decided to go on.
</p>

<p>
"I can understand you don't want to discuss it; neither
would I, but you must have meant to tell me eventually.  After
all, I have a right to know, mother."
</p>

<p>
Emily saw she was desperately in earnest.  "What are you
talking about?" she asked, puzzled.
</p>

<p>
Martha spoke slowly.  "I mean&mdash;about my father&mdash;about
Uncle Jim."
</p>

<p>
Emily understood then.  The shock brought a cry of horror
from her.  "Oh, Martha!"
</p>

<p>
Martha knew pain when she heard it.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mammie!" she cried back, running to Emily, sitting
down close to her.  "Mammie, don't cry!  Don't think I care!
I'd a million times rather have him for my father!  I never
loved you, really, before!  I didn't pry into it.  Honestly,
mammie, it just came to me, like the morning; like light flashing
into me, mammie!"
</p>

<p>
Emily had drawn away from her and covered her face with
her hands.  Martha thought she was crying.  She besought
her tenderly:
</p>

<p>
"Mammie, don't you mind my understanding it.  Oh, if you
knew how I felt about it!  When I think of you living here all
these years!  I started to come home to you the minute I
realized it.  It came to me like a flash in front of Woolworth's
in State Street, there.  I was walking along, blue enough to
die; I just wanted to die, I was so sore.  And I saw that front
and I remembered going into Woolworth's <i>here</i>, between you
and Uncle Jim.  I don't mind calling him that; it's a dear name
for him.  I remembered all of a sudden just how you looked at
each other.  Mammie, it just stunned me when I understood.
I hadn't gone a block before I saw it all.  I don't know why I
didn't always understand it.  Because he always was just
naturally my father, wasn't he?  Nobody ever had to teach me to
love HIM!  Dad never felt that way about me, naturally.  It
wasn't his fault he never had any interest in me.  I knew why
you stood Bronson, then!  I remembered how you looked
after the funeral!  I was so excited I just couldn't stand up.
I sat down on a bench in the public library lobby, and just sat
there!  Oh, I never appreciated you till now, mammie!  I'm
going to take care of you now.  When I think of you living
year in and year out in this house with dad&mdash;I'll call him that!
I don't care about names!  The way you've put it across right
here, in this dirty gossipy little town, and nobody DARED to
suspect you of anything!  Not ANYTHING!  Why do you look
at me that way?  You intended to tell me some time, surely!"
</p>

<p>
Now for the first time in her life Emily had drawn away
from her child in repulsion.  She had started to speak; she had
started to cry out her denial.  But that young, eager, relit face
was close to hers.  No matter how illuminating the mistake
was, the poor distorted child must know the truth.  But as
Emily opened her lips to speak, the poor distorted child went
on; she had seized Emily's hand in both her own:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, now I know what they mean, being born again.  I was
just born again, mammie!  I know now why you never scolded
me&mdash;why you stood by me; you understood.  You've been
through it!  And everybody loves you; they just bless you!
You aren't afraid they'll find it out.  You just go on!  I'm
going on, too!  My God! how I'm going on!  If you can put
this across, so can I!  You never were afraid of dad finding
it out, even, were you?"
</p>

<p>
Emily Kenworthy murmured, "No."  She meant to add,
"There was never anything to find out, you bad, silly girl!"
but she didn't.
</p>

<p>
She could find no excuse for her conduct, as she thought it
over, that night.  She had simply been hypnotized by the beauty
of that child's eagerness.  It had been such a long time since
she had seen eagerness, hopefulness, twinkling out of that
little sweet face of hers, that she hadn't had courage to darken
it again.  Martha had just sat there, caressing her, babbling
out her enjoyment of her mother's infamy, until Greta's older
sister had come in.  Emily had made her entrance an excuse
for getting away to her room.  And there she had sat dazedly,
hurt, ashamed of her daughter, more ashamed of herself.  How
could I have hesitated a minute!  I ought to have corrected her
the minute she dared to suggest that to me!  But what difference
does it make?  It's good enough for Bob!  He never appreciated
her!  What do I care what she thinks, if it does her
any good?  I'm not high and holy any longer!  I understand
her!  Hasn't she any sense of honor at all, that she's so
pleased?  Why should I be so shocked?  Didn't I plan often
enough to leave Bob and go to Jim?  She only accused me of
what I often wanted to do!  I gave that up, and this is what
I get for it!  She wishes she was Jim's.  She thinks I went
on living with Bob!  "My God!" cried Emily.  "But she can't
help it; she has to suspect somebody.  It's her luck, after what
she's done.  Why should I feel so sick about this?"
</p>

<p>
And even while she sat there feeling sick at heart, Martha's
voice came dancing up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Mammie, what are you doing?  Can't you come down a minute?"
</p>

<p>
And Emily had gone down, hardening her heart.  "I'm never
going to tell her the truth," she was vowing.  "Let her think
that, if it does her any good!"  And all that evening she had
talked and listened to talking, like one in a dream.  Whatever
she said, it was of Martha's base accusation that she was
conscious.  "Surely," she was thinking, "if I gave Jim up once
for this child, I can give up Bob and my scruples, just in her
mind, for a little while."  She was so preoccupied with her
thoughts that she scarcely spoke during supper.  Bob noticed
her quietness.  She had been gay at dinner.  He was the more
affable to Martha.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Miss Curtis now?  Is she coming down for Christmas?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  She's gone to Ruth&mdash;to Indiana."
</p>

<p>
"Well, she's a nice sort of a woman, for a school-teacher."  Emily
saw the cynical smile that came about Martha's mouth.
</p>

<p>
"You bet she is!" she replied, enthusiastically.  "But you
ought to see the doctor.  Dad, she'd show you a thing or two."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I like about Miss Curtis.  You can trust her
to mind her own business.  You feel safe with her."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you, though?  You can trust her absolutely, couldn't
you, dad?  You could always be sure she'd be upright, couldn't
you?"
</p>

<p>
Upright was a strange adjective.  Bob looked up to see if
Martha had begun spoofing him again.  She looked innocent,
but he changed the subject.  Martha looked knowingly across
at her mother.  Emily wanted to spank her.
</p>

<p>
Later in the evening again she experienced the same desire.
She came into the sitting room to hear Martha cajoling over
the 'phone the most conventional, conservative, disapproving
woman who ever eyed bobbed hair and short skirts maliciously.
"But we want you so, Mrs. Mason.  Everybody says there's no
one who can get as much work done in one afternoon as you."  And
on she talked, till she hung up the 'phone triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"Martha, why in the world did you invite <i>her</i> here?" Emily
asked.
</p>

<p>
Martha winked at her naughtily.  "I just asked her because
she's so extra holy!" she answered, and she laughed.  She had
the upper hand of life now, that girl!
</p>

<p>
She ought to have been pitifully spanked, but now that she
had got things under way, there was scarcely time to reprove
her.  Emily remembered the days when Bob had complained
that he could never get her alone long enough to "settle her."  The
house was bustling and hurrying about, as Martha used to
make it stir, full of her girl friends coming and going, confused
by committee women of inspired importance.  School children
were singing their parts at the piano; angels were adjusting
their feathers in the hall; the 'phone was ringing.  Emily
watched Martha "putting it across," each day a little more
naughtily, a little more triumphantly.  She apparently intended
to be as highly respected in the town as her deceitful mother.
It was not pleasant, to say the least, to see her sitting deferring
with studied docility to the opinion of women whom Emily
knew she was scorning with all her might.  Never before had
she been quite such a "nice girl."  She was demure; she was
discreet; she gave someone else credit for every good idea she
put forth quietly, graciously; she made her elderly neighbors
smile at her mother as if to say "What a clever child this is
of yours."  And, when they left, she would hug her mother,
grinning, chuckling.  Thick as two thieves they were, together
in conspiracy.
</p>

<p>
The only thing that seemed difficult to explain about Martha
was the absence of admirers who had formerly beset her father
round about.  Johnnie, of course, had not come home from the
East, but there were numbers of young collegians who had
returned for Christmas.  Why, Emily wondered, did they avoid
the Kenworthy house?  She understood one evening when she
overheard a conversation between Greta and her daughter.
</p>

<p>
"I told Hally I was coming here.  I asked him to come along,
but he wouldn't."  A giggle.  "Do you know what he said
about you, Martha?"
</p>

<p>
"What?"  The tone was wholly indifferent.
</p>

<p>
"He said: 'No; I'm not going there.  Martie's mad.  She's
taken to biting.'"
</p>

<p>
Then Martha's voice, full of interest, "Did he honestly say
that?"  She seemed gratified.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, honest he did."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't suppose he had that much sense," Martha said,
simply.
</p>

<p>
Later: "But why?  Tell me the truth, Martie!  Why aren't
you dancing?"
</p>

<p>
"I have told you the truth.  I've learned my lesson; I can't
stand late hours.  I don't want another breakdown like that
one last winter.  I tell you I go to bed regularly early.  I'm in
bed every night at half past ten."
</p>

<p>
A silence.
</p>

<p>
Then: "That'll do to tell!  I bet if Johnnie Benton was here
to dance with, your health would be all right!"
</p>

<p>
"Johnnie Benton?"  Scorn and derision at such a suggestion.
"Excuse me if I seem to yawn.  Anyway, he's engaged to
somebody down East."
</p>

<p>
"Who said so?  You're making that up!  I don't believe it."
</p>

<p>
"Nobody told me.  It's likely, you know that.  The way
he goes round proposing to everybody."
</p>

<p>
"He never proposed to me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, get out!  He must have!"
</p>

<p>
Martha was rejoicing in her own hypocrisy.  She was guzzling
down the impression she made.  People said it was too
sweet of her to have thought of bringing old Miss Knight to
the party tenderly in her car.  For Miss Knight was a decrepit
old primary teacher of Martha's infancy, who seldom went out,
and she had beamed every minute of the afternoon upon the
dancing children, and blessed Martha loudly for her kindness
in bringing her, as Martha had counted on her doing.  Martha
had remembered the poor.  The poor, now, were hard to find
in that town.  But Martha had sought out a family whose
house had been burned recently, and bestirred even protesting
Greta to help her to succor them.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't be such a lazy selfish pig, Greta!" she had
gurgled when the room was fullest of listeners.  She had talked,
too, cunningly of the turkey she was roasting for Christmas
dinner.
</p>

<p>
"I never had a chance to roast a turkey before," she said to
mothers whose daughters were known to be indifferent to
cook-stoves, "but I've always wanted to.  I adore making mince
pies; I'm making a lot of mincemeat, all myself, to take back
with me.  Yes, I'm fond of cooking.  I get my own dinners
with Miss Curtis, my friend in Chicago.  I have more time
than she does.  She teaches school; but, of course, now that
I'm in business, I'm busier."  And she would look at the neighbors
simply, quietly.  She even dared to say innocently to her
mother, just when the gossips might be supposed to be listening:
</p>

<p>
"Did I tell you, mammie, I met Eve the other day?  She's
given up New York.  Her father isn't well and she's going to
stay in Chicago.  She's coming down for a week-end soon, if
he's better."
</p>

<p>
And when the neighbors would be gone she would run and
give her mother gloating hugs, which asked as plainly as her
voice could have spoken, "Don't I just get it across?"
</p>

<p>
Emily had asked, afterwards: "Did you really meet Eve?
When?"
</p>

<p>
And she pretended to be indignant.  "Did I meet her?  I
like your nerve!  Do you suppose I'm not telling you the
truth?  She is coming down to see you.  She said to me, right
out, as soon as I saw her, 'Are you still sore about&mdash;that?'  I
just said: 'About what?  Where've you been all the time?
Why don't you write mother oftener?  She wants to see you.
Come on down with me.'  This was at the station, mammie,
just when I was coming home the other day.  If she comes
down here to stay with us, what can anybody say about&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
She held the situation in a tight grasp now.  If any minute
of those busy days she had suffered one pang, remembering the
desperate Christmas a year ago, she had never once given a
sign of it.  Since the day of her first accusation of her mother
she had avoided the subject of her paternity excessively.
Emily, too, had been afraid of it.  She had told Martha firmly
that she was not going to Chicago to live with her.  Martha,
for fear she might make explanations, had not argued the
subject very far.
</p>

<p>
"I never would be content to live in Chicago, you know that,
Martha.  Our roots are here; I'm too old to be transplanted.
I won't leave this house."
</p>

<p>
"But you get bored to death, mammie.  You want to shriek
sometimes.  You said you did yourself that night, at the
doctor's.  I hate to go away and leave you here."
</p>

<p>
"Stay here then.  This is your home."
</p>

<p>
"No.  I've got to <i>do</i> something.  It's all right here, when
there's a party on, or something.  But I couldn't stand it all
the time.  I'd get to scrapping with dad, you know I would."
</p>

<p>
The very mention of Bob brought up possibilities of
uncomfortable remarks.
</p>

<p>
Martha hastened to continue.
</p>

<p>
"I'll come back just as often as I can.  And you come and
stay with me as much as you can.  And in June we'll go to
Europe together.  Nobody can talk about that!  And maybe
you'll like it well enough to stay a year or two with me there;
lots of people do.  And that's the only place really to learn
about furnishings and furniture."
</p>

<p>
Emily lay in her bed that night, ashamed and unhappy.  "It's
as if I had told her the most enormous and fundamental lie," she
reflected.  "Nothing good can ever come of this.  Strange,"
she thought, "that I can't remember ever going into
Woolworth's with Jim!  She remembers something of him that I
don't.  How old would she have been then?  The five-and-ten
must have come to town&mdash;well&mdash;before Bronson came.  She
loved that store at first, when she was little."  She grudged
Martha a memory that belonged essentially to her; she thought
greedily over every look of his she had ever treasured.  She
remembered their early love; she recalled still how his dear
hands had gone longing, discreetly up inside her stiff cuffs.
She remembered his kisses; she remembered how he had come
back in the days of his weariness to his mother, and how they
had looked across at each other, with that innocent old woman
between them.  She remembered how he used to sit with little
Martha on his knee, in the days of his ill health and bitterness,
stroking her hair and looking into her face, trying some
way to get close to the mother through the child.  She thought
of that summer, and of Bronson, and of Jim's irrepressible
crying-out to her.  She stopped there.  She tried always not
to think of his death.  "He just kissed me," she said, "and went
away."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she cried to herself, "I'm going to Chicago to-morrow
and tell Martha the truth!  He was too sweet, too dear.  This
isn't fair to him.  I don't care about Bob; but I won't have
her thinking such things of Jim.  He was too good for
such&mdash;baseness.  He never forgot I was his brother's wife.  He did
kiss me, but he went away then.  That's the point&mdash;he went
away.  I'll tell her that.
</p>

<p>
"And if I tell her, she'll never believe me.  She thinks I'm
sly and sneaking and adulterous now, and if I tell her the
truth, she'll think I'm lying to her.  She hasn't enough
experience yet to believe the truth; she doesn't know enough to
believe it.  That's why she hates it all so! herself, and passion.
All she knows of passion is its roots, in the dark ground; its
blossom in the air, its sweet lovely blossom in the sun she hasn't
seen.  She doesn't know forbearance or tenderness, and that's
the best part of it&mdash;for us.  She wouldn't believe me if I
told her what sort of man he was.  I don't know what's going
to become of her now; she'll never marry now.  Probably that
way such a lot of women don't marry; the roots of it all look
so ugly, so brutal to them.  If I could make Martha believe in
some one like Jim now!  The whole tragedy is that she can't."
</p>

<p>
When she fell asleep at last, she was thinking still of her
lover&mdash;not, however, that he went away, but that he kissed her.
</p>

<p>
Martha hadn't been gone two weeks when that most astonishing
news came.  Nothing could have stunned the town more
than that.  The telegram came first to Emily.  She heard it
over the 'phone.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Benton had died suddenly, while motoring in California.
</p>

<p>
People gathered in groups on the street to discuss it.  It
seemed a thing that could not be true.  To be sure, when you
thought it over, you realized that Mrs. Benton was but mortal;
but it seemed so unlike her, just to die, to quit, to lay things
down.  Her body, lifeless, was to be sent home for burial.
</p>

<p>
Recovering by degrees from the shock of the news; the
cruder ones began asking under their breaths what the more
sentimental ones had but pondered.  Had she lived to hear of
the success of the Christmas party?  They could not believe
that she had.  It didn't seem likely.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Benton's body was to arrive on a Thursday, from the
West.  Johnnie arrived from the East on Tuesday morning, to
find his home swept and garnished and in possession of an
old and silent aunt and a young and gushing one.  He came to
Emily for refuge that evening.  He seemed almost stupefied
by the event.  Emily had never thought of him as a nervous
man before.  He talked in a way unnaturally incoherent, and
he stirred about nervously, unable to sit down.  The second
time she noticed his hand refrain spasmodically from a cigarette,
she said:
</p>

<p>
"Smoke if you want to."
</p>

<p>
But he burst out: "No.  I won't have people laughing&mdash;about
THIS.  I won't have them talking about her."
</p>

<p>
"But no one is going to talk about her if you smoke here
with me."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think so?  Nobody would see me?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Nobody could find anything to laugh at in that."
</p>

<p>
He was already lighting a match.  "I thought they looked
at me funny when I went to light up," he said.  Emily knew
he spoke of his aunts.  "I want everything done right for her.
I won't have people talking about THIS.  They say I have
to be the chief mourner, Mrs. Kenworthy."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you are that, Johnnie; you're nearest her."
</p>

<p>
"I know it; but they made me stay in there to see the
minister.  He asked me what chapter I wanted read!  I felt like
a fool, Mrs. Kenworthy.  I felt like a dirty hypocrite!"
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't feel that way.  These things have got to be
done, apparently."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think 'Jesus, Lover of my Soul' is better than 'Lead,
Kindly Light'?  One wants one and the other wants the other,
and they say I can decide!  Look here, Mrs. Kenworthy, did
you ever hear that mother hadn't but a year to live?  Did she
ever tell YOU that?"
</p>

<p>
"No, never.  Why, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Ethel said the doctor in Chicago told somebody yesterday
that he told her last summer she hadn't a year to live.
Didn't she tell you that?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"She never told me; she never told anybody."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe she didn't believe it."
</p>

<p>
He seemed relieved at the thought.  He said, "Maybe that's
it.  But she never told you where I was last summer, did she,
until I was about coming home?  Do you know why?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know why.  Never mind, Johnnie!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she didn't know where I was; I didn't tell her!  I
just lit out; I never told her till I got to Hong-Kong.  I knew
she'd worry; I didn't care if she did.  I never thought of it
coming out like this, Mrs. Kenworthy!  I made enough to
come home on at Macao.  You know, gambling, she'd call it;
it was, too.  I won five hundred dollars, almost&mdash;-four hundred
and seventy&mdash;so then I cabled her.  Oh, I don't know why I
did that!"
</p>

<p>
"There's no use grieving over it now, Johnnie."
</p>

<p>
"But by the time I got her answer I had lost it all again.
I came home on the money she cabled me.  She met me at
the depot with a new car!  She never told me she wasn't well;
she never told ME she hadn't long to live!  I'm glad I went
back to college; she wanted me to do that.  I nearly didn't, I
nearly lit out again.  If they insist on having the coffin open
in church and me looking&mdash;in front of everybody&mdash;I don't care.
I'll do it; I won't have people laughing at her <i>now</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Then Emily remembered a certain hour.  "Oh, Johnnie!"
she began.  And, as she understood the significance of what
she recalled, she hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"She told me once, not so very long ago, that she'd written
out directions for her funeral.  She hated sensational
funerals&mdash;and people fainting.  She wanted hers very simple."
</p>

<p>
"When was this?"
</p>

<p>
Now Emily remembered too distinctly, all of a sudden.
</p>

<p>
"It was after somebody's funeral, as we were walking home
from the cemetery.  I don't remember&mdash;when, exactly."  Why
should she tell the boy it had happened when he was sailing
away towards Brazil and his deserted mother had learned her
fate in loneliness?  "I imagine if you go down to Johnson and
Larned's, they'll have her directions put away with her will."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do you think&mdash;I ought to do that?  I mean&mdash;I don't
want to seem to be grabbing her will in a hurry!"
</p>

<p>
"Ask your aunts about it.  I'll go over and tell them with
you, if you want me to."
</p>

<p>
"Will you?  Oh, do!  But wait a little.  Can't I have another
smoke here, first?  It seems&mdash;strange, over there, this way."
</p>

<p>
And as he walked around smoking, Emily thought: "Yes,
and she knew all the time as we walked home together that
day that she'd be there in the cemetery soon, and she never
told me.  She wanted me to know she had given directions for
her funeral, and she let me think she had no special reason for
giving them; and she didn't know where this boy was, or
whether she would ever see him again, and she never said a
word to me about it.  And she pointed out to me Mrs. Johnson's
red lilies as we passed, and said she was going to move
hers into the sun!"
</p>

<p>
Martha came down for the funeral, which was delayed with
absolute cruelty, Emily thought, by the aunts, until Saturday.
Emily told her of Mrs. Benton's stoicism, but not of Johnnie's
unconscious hardness.
</p>

<p>
And Martha sighed and said, merely, "Well, I suppose everybody
has something up their sleeve, mammie!"
</p>

<p>
Johnnie came in on Friday evening, harassed and red eyed.
</p>

<p>
"You here, Martie!" he exclaimed, touched by the sight of
her.  "For the love of Mike, don't let anyone know I'm here.
Let's go up to your sitting room!  Somebody'll be coming in.
I want to smoke; I got to have a smoke!"
</p>

<p>
A pitiful Johnnie made Martha kind.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't heated up," she said.  "We don't heat it now, weather
like this.  But you can come and wash dishes with me.  You
can smoke there; nobody'll see you."
</p>

<p>
It was the usual thing for Martha to insist on Emily's staying
in the living room when Martha was washing the evening dishes.
So she remained there, and people came in, as Johnnie had
foreseen they would.  One hour passed, and another, and the
supper dishes still apparently detained the young things.  After
another half-hour Emily went to the kitchen.  She opened the
door.
</p>

<p>
The scene was scarcely what she had expected.  The room
was thick with smoke; and there, huddled over the stove, sat
old Maggie, who was supposed to have gone to bed hours ago,
and across her old rough face her mouth stretched from ear
to ear in one great beaming smile, while her eyes looked straight
at the chief mourner.  He sat on the kitchen table, near the
prunes soaking in the bowl overnight.  He still had on the
blue-gingham apron some one had tied about his slender body.  He
was leaning forward alertly, and in his hand he held a cigarette
all lit and ready to go into his mouth the moment the flow of
his eager narrative ceased for an instant.  His eyes were fixed
upon Martha, who sat on the high kitchen stool with her feet on
its upper rungs.  She had on a red jersey frock; she sported a
very long purple-and-black cigarette holder and she sat listening
intently, her chin atilt.
</p>

<p>
"And the chief&mdash;he was a good old sport&mdash;he says to the
captain, 'It's the first time I was ever ordered to get a lady
out of a&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
He saw the door opening.  He saw Emily.  She knew at
once that she had spoiled a perfect hour.  Johnnie's normal
light-heartedness collapsed.  Emily saw him recalling horribly
the coffin and its contents, and the hushed and exaggerated
reverence of those that waited about it.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" he groaned.  "Oh, I forget!"
</p>

<p>
But Martha had heard nothing of his quarrel with his mother
and his passionate desire to atone as far as he could by all
conventional decencies.
</p>

<p>
"Well, go on!" she commanded.  "Was the man dead?"
</p>

<p>
But Johnnie had no gusto for the rest of his tale.  "I was
just telling Martha about what happened on the <i>Pomona</i>," he
murmured to Emily, apologetically.  "There was a woman
drunk, and she locked the door of her cabin and wouldn't
open it; they couldn't hear the man with her and they thought
maybe she had done something to him."
</p>

<p>
"But what happened in the end?" Martha insisted.
</p>

<p>
"The captain broke in, and there was the man, reading in his
bunk.  He said he wasn't going to try to get her to open the
door; he knew her.  He'd been reading the History of Poland,
with nothing but biscuit to eat.  He said he was used to it.  I
didn't know it was so late.  I got to be going."
</p>

<p>
"Don't go yet," Emily urged.  "We've never really heard
anything about your trip."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean to stay so long.  I don't want to make them
sore at me," he said, nervously.  "They look at me so funny all
the time."
</p>

<p>
He went back to them.  Bob and Martha sat for a while talking,
and Emily sat looking at them and thinking wistfully of
what she had seen in the kitchen.  How happy those children
had been together in their young forgetfulness, a forgetfulness
somewhat too facile, on Johnnie's part, perhaps.  Yet what a
fine relief it had been for him from the strain and depression
of those unnatural days.  Surely each of them must be thinking
how snugly, how cozily they had together thrown off their
burdens.  If only it could have gone on!  Martha would have
married him now, likely, since the maternal handicap was
removed&mdash;if that other thing had never happened.  Johnnie, free
and with an income, wouldn't be long in marrying&mdash;someone,
Emily was convinced of that.  But it would be a long time, a
deplorably long time, before Martha would be settling down.
There was no use hoping for so happy an ending to that story.
</p>

<p>
It was perhaps her kindness to Johnnie that cleansed Martha's
mind, for the time, from its chilling cynicism.  She was lovely
that evening and gentle, and subdued.  Emily lingered about
with her in the guest room, and sat on her bed a long time
with her, yearning over her.  She had never felt so sure and
mature a sort of oneness with her daughter before.  Martha
wouldn't let her get away.  She clung to her; her trivial words
were little caresses.  It was an hour to be remembered, to be
tasted carefully in memory, and relished indefinitely.
</p>

<p>
Emily's conscience smote her the more that night.  How
terrible this deception of her was!  All at once there came to her
a thought cuttingly vivid.  People did die suddenly; no doubt
about that; even an extremely living woman like Cora Benton
ceased without warning.  "Suppose I'd die suddenly, myself!"
Emily gasped.  "Suppose I should die without ever telling her
the truth!  She'd have this house for herself then; she might
quarrel with her father; she might turn him out of it in some
evil moment.  She might even tell him some time what I let her
think.  To-morrow morning," Emily decided, "first thing, I'll
tell her the truth."  She lay unhappily trying to screw herself up
to the necessary intensity of determination.
</p>

<p>
In the morning, however, Martha didn't come down to breakfast.
Emily went up to her room.  She said she was tired,
and Emily saw at once she had been crying.  She offered to
bring her up something, but Martha refused shortly.  She
said she was going to get up; she wouldn't stay in bed.  Not
one least hint of the conciliatory mood of the evening before
was left.  Emily was afraid of her, afraid of the bitter things
that might come slashing out of her mouth.  If only she knew
what she had been crying about!  Was it because the companionship
of the evening had seemed as pleasant as unattainable?
Had she been by any chance thinking how happy she
might have been with Johnnie?  Or had she been mourning the
lover who had destroyed himself in her mind?  Emily came
downstairs and set about her morning work hesitant, cautious,
and perplexed.
</p>

<p>
Even as they sat side by side in the crowded church, Emily
was conscious of the hardness of her mood.  Mrs. Benton might
reasonably have asked to have a sermon preached over her body
in the great hall she had built, but she had commanded that the
service should be in the small Congregational church.  Emily,
when she went to that church, always thought of Jim's mother&mdash;rather
than Bob's&mdash;and of his father, whose heroic death was
but a mildly interesting tale to Martha.  The crowded service
promised at first to be all that Mrs. Benton had hoped it never
would be, but the minister, when he began speaking, showed
more sense than Emily had ever thought him capable of.  She
saw Johnnie almost immediately lift his bewildered head to
listen.
</p>

<p>
"Our sister," he said, "lies here silent.  Her works praise her.
Which one of us," he asked, "can lift a voice to contradict them?
Dare we dispute with the bathing beach?  Shall we try arguing
with the memorial hall?"  He named over her civic accomplishments,
scarcely mentioning the flowers that were to bloom all
over the county in the spring&mdash;they, Emily thought, might have
suggested to the scoffing, or the conscience-smitten, a certain
joyous derision.  "There had been women more gentle than
she," he said, frankly, "But the gentle women had dammed no
river.  There had been women more popular, but the popular
had built no bridges.  What she had built, she had built well.
Let the town, now, if it could, reach the standard of excellence
which she had set.  Her example of doing things exactly right
was a heritage not to be despised in these shoddy days."
</p>

<p>
But of all her works, he averred, the beach had the clearest
voice and the holiest.  "Wash ye!  Make ye clean!" the prophets
of God had been crying, through all the generations.  And now
the beach took up the song, inviting all the children to throw
themselves into the cleanness of joy and to dive deep into the
transparency of living.  It was the element of cleanness that
she had made precious to the children of the town.  How many
small boys of the town cared where their winter clothes were
put away for the summer?  But how many of them would there
be who weren't conscious all the winter just where their bathing
suits were put away waiting for the summer?  The snow would
scarcely be melted on the south slopes of the lawns until
children began shaking out their bathing suits and counting the
weeks until swimming began.  The dancing feet of the young,
and the music of their youth, praised this woman all the winter
months.  And in the summer, tanned and barefooted memorials
of her would soon be running down all the shaded streets to
the river.  And healthy dripping tributes to her wisdom would
be trudging home late to meals.  When there were no longer
any children to love swimming, he said suddenly, he hoped the
town would build a stone memorial to its benefactress.
</p>

<p>
He sat down.
</p>

<p>
The church sighed its agreement.
</p>

<p>
The coffin, unopened, was carried away.  Johnnie said
afterwards that the minister had sense.

<h3>
<i>Chapter Eleven</i>
</h3>

<p>
That night Bob Kenworthy sat unsuspectingly reading a coon
story in a popular weekly, in his own living room, in the
light of a lamp his daughter had given him for Christmas.  His
wife sat at her desk near the window, pretending to write
letters, and every once in a while she glanced slyly over at him
to see if he was conscious of what she was doing; and sometimes
she even looked suspiciously at the curtains to make sure
no one was peeping in at the words she had guiltily written.
She had sat there more than an hour, and she was beginning
that letter in vain.  A more distasteful task she had seldom
decided upon.  To put down in black and white a denial of
the grotesque mistake she had suffered to continue in Martha's
thought seemed impossible.  An acknowledgment of her
complicity in the misunderstanding seemed too humiliating.  How
could she be sure, besides, into whose hands her written words
might not come?  Might not that complacent husband of hers,
sitting there, never imagining how thankfully he had been
discarded by his child, sometime come upon the letter that must
seem to him treacherous?  Emily didn't intend sending the
letter to Martha; that course was too perilous to consider.  She
intended to put it away, in case of such an emergency as this
last one of Cora Benton's.  It seemed, however, the right
thing altogether for Cora Benton to have given directions for
her funeral.  The community expected her to do that.  But for
Emily Kenworthy to do it seemed silly melodrama.
</p>

<p>
She sat with her arm hiding the words she had written, now
that she had begun for the fifth time, though there was no eye
in the room to behold them.  She had finished.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Child."  She had got down a further sentence or
two.  "I couldn't collect my wits in time the other day to tell
you what a mistaken idea you had of your father and me.  I
have never been unfaithful to him in my life."  She glanced
again guiltily at Bob.  Poor old harmless thing!  He had been
certainly&mdash;good and a patient husband.  And, sitting there, he
did look like Jim.  The elusive likeness between the two had
always fascinated her; Jim's head had been like that.  His
face was longer, finer, more delicate.  It was for Jim's sake,
of course, and not Bob's she was writing this.  She would not
have Martha thinking Jim a common old love pirate!  She
took her arms from across the paper; she re-read what she had
written.  "I have never been unfaithful to him in my life."  Then
she added, impulsively, "I never had a chance to be."  She
studied her achievement, and covered it up with a blotter
and sat thinking.  Then she went at it again for a few minutes.
"I am writing this to you the day of Mrs. Benton's funeral in
case I haven't an opportunity to tell you personally."  She was
on the point of adding, "Your uncle wasn't that sort of man."  But
suppose Bob should sometime see those words?  She might
say, "The Kenworthy men are too good for that sort of
thing."  Yes, that might do.
</p>

<p>
Bob threw down his paper.  Emily jumped.
</p>

<p>
"Some coon story!" he yawned.  "Let's go to bed."
</p>

<p>
"You go on up, Bob," she said, earnestly.  "I'm just coming."
</p>

<p>
When he came up from "fixing the furnace" she was rearranging
her desk.  In the center of it was a little compartment
that could be locked but seldom was.  It was full of rather
useless trifles.  She had found the little key to it now in a small
adjoining drawer, and she had locked away a small envelope
inclosed in the very center of several larger ones.  It was
addressed to Martha, "to be opened after my death."  As she
went upstairs wondering where to hide that key, she felt more
like a perfect fool than she had felt in years.  She looked about
the room.  At one side of her bureau there hung an enlarged
snapshot of Martha as a four-year-old, hugging a puppy.  Emily
had always thought it a perfectly beautiful picture.  When Bob
was in the bathroom, she went cautiously over to it and tied
the key to the wire by which the picture hung.  "Nobody would
ever find it there if I <i>should</i> die," she said to herself; "and
besides I probably won't."  But later, when she heard Bob sleeping,
she got up gently and hid the key in the bottom drawer of
the bureau beneath some summer underthings, for, of course,
Maggie would dust that picture as soon as she was able to be
about, and demand to be told what key that was.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards she would say to herself, waking in the night:
"Well, suppose anyone <i>should</i> find that key and open the desk
and see the letter.  It's a very sensible thing to leave directions
for your funeral.  Everybody ought to do it.  Still..."
</p>

<p>
And Johnnie Benton was about from time to time, reminding
her of the possibility of sudden death.  He wouldn't go back
to school.  He might have agreed, in the shock of his grief,
to conform to all burial conventions out of respect for his
mother.  But to go back and try for a degree, he refused
absolutely and confidently.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't told THEM," he said to Emily, nodding his head
towards the house where his aunts still tarried.  "Aunt Grace
wants to keep house for me!"  The tone of his voice suggested
she had proposed at least to murder him.  "I told them I'd go
back as soon as it's settled, all the business; but I couldn't get a
degree in ten years if I did go back.  And goodness knows
when things will be settled."  The delay wasn't annoying
Johnnie.
</p>

<p>
Even Emily grew uneasy about Johnnie as the weeks passed.
She wondered sometimes, remembering a sort of threat, if his
mother had really disinherited him.  Her lawyers, whom he was
always going to consult in Chicago, were saying now that
Mrs. Benton had gone to California for the express purpose of
investigating investments there, and presently the results would
come to light.  Emily didn't see clearly why Johnnie should
have to drive up to Chicago three days a week to learn such
meager facts.  He stayed in Chicago so much that his aunts
closed the house and went home.  And then when he came home
he stayed with the Kenworthys.
</p>

<p>
He stayed with them depressed, silent, and inactive.  Emily
was troubled about his laziness; but, after all, she had been his
mother's stanchest friend and she owed him some sympathy and
patience.  She was as kind to him as possible.
</p>

<p>
But not so Martha.  She came down suddenly for a week-end,
the last of February.  Emily told her to go into the small
guest room; Johnnie's things were in the other.
</p>

<p>
"Good night!" she cried.  "Is he <i>here</i>, too?"
</p>

<p>
Was he then so much in Martha's Chicago?
</p>

<p>
"Now look here, mammie, I don't approve of this.  He's
taking advantage of you.  Why can't he stay at the hotel?"
</p>

<p>
"Martha, if you like the hotel so well, you'd better go down
and try a meal there!  It isn't a comfortable place, and you
know it."
</p>

<p>
"But why doesn't he stay at the Kendalls' or at the
Johnsons'?  Why can't he stay with his friends?"
</p>

<p>
"Those boys aren't at home now, you know that."
</p>

<p>
"Well, he needn't try to&mdash;get a stand-in here just because his
mother is dead.  Why don't he live in his own house, like
anybody else would?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know you were coming down, child.  I didn't
know you would object.  After all, you can't live in Chicago
and dictate who's to stay with me here."
</p>

<p>
"No, I suppose not.  But you have enough to do without
taking care of Johnnie Benton.  Why doesn't he go to work?"
</p>

<p>
"He does work&mdash;sometimes.  He works in the garage."
</p>

<p>
Martha turned about, flabbergasted.  "You mean&mdash;dad's
garage?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, of all the nerve!  Look here, mammie, I tell you just
now there's no use of dad trying to put that over on me.  You
can just tell him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My dear child, don't be silly!  Nobody's trying to put
anything over on you."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I can marry anybody I want to, as well as not!
Women do it all the time and never say a word!  But you
needn't think I'm going to; you can get that idea out of your
head right now!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come out of it, Martha!  Nobody's trying to make you
do anything you don't want to."
</p>

<p>
It would, perhaps, have been foolish to try that.  For
Martha seemed able to manage.  Emily didn't know exactly
how she had done it, but Johnnie came up presently from down-town,
saw her there, greeted her quite undisturbed and casually,
and announced he was going to Chicago for the week-end.
</p>

<p>
And all Martha said was, "I'll let you know next time before
I come, mammie."
</p>

<p>
Emily felt encouraged about Martha in those days.  About
Johnnie she grew less and less certain as the spring came on.
</p>

<p>
Once she had to say to him: "Johnnie, I want to ask you
something.  I want you to tell me what your plans are.  What
are you going to do?"
</p>

<p>
He was walking about her living room gloomily, with his
hands in his pockets.  He stopped and looked at her.  She
liked him, and she saw she had hurt him deeply.
</p>

<p>
"You getting sore at me, too?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, "but you <i>are</i> going to work sometime, of
course?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm working now," he said.  He stopped in front of her.
He stroked his hair nervously.  "I'm trying to persuade Martha
to marry me!" he said, bluntly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Johnnie!" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"You mean she won't?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Johnnie, no!  I don't think she will.  I don't think Martha'll
marry&mdash;young.  It doesn't seem to me&mdash;that it's likely."
</p>

<p>
"You mean&mdash;that affair&mdash;last summer&mdash;the summer before
last?"
</p>

<p>
If she had meant it she had not meant him to refer to it.
"That affair?"  How could Johnnie Benton know about it?
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;yes," she acknowledged, "and other things.  She isn't
very domestic."
</p>

<p>
"I beg to differ with you!"  Johnnie spoke with some heat.
"She <i>is</i> domestic.  She loves houses.  You know she loves
houses and&mdash;things."
</p>

<p>
"Well, anyway, Johnnie, I think&mdash;she'd be just as apt to
marry you&mdash;if you went to work; maybe more so.  Not that I
think&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Johnnie lifted his head, as if to ward off her reproof.  "I'm
sick of this," he burst out.  "People think I ought to settle
down.  Well, I would settle down&mdash;if Martha'd agree.  I'd
settle down here, or any place.  It doesn't much matter what
business I go into; I'll likely be a failure in any of 'em.  I'll
have enough to live on for us both.  But if Martha won't, I'm
going to pull out of this for a year or so; let them settle the
estate to suit themselves.  I can't be bothered with it.  I'm going
to sea for a year&mdash;till I get things into my own hands."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Johnnie, what do you want to go to sea for?  There's
something better than that, surely?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll have to earn my living&mdash;for a while, if things don't
get settled up.  The bank's howling about advancing me any
more money.  As if there wasn't plenty coming to me, some
place!  They won't let me sell the house, even, till the estate's
settled.".
</p>

<p>
"Oh, were you thinking of that?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not, Mrs. Kenworthy?  Martha&mdash;wouldn't want to
live in it."
</p>

<p>
"Johnnie, I'd give that up, if I were you.  I wouldn't count
on that."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I <i>won't</i> give up.  I mean I don't give a&mdash;cent&mdash;what
else happens."
</p>

<p>
Emily exclaimed.  "You know there's nothing I would have
liked so well."
</p>

<p>
"If what?"
</p>

<p>
"If it&mdash;were&mdash;possible," she contented herself with saying.
"We can't force these things, Johnnie."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;it was all right <i>once</i>, Mrs. Kenworthy."
</p>

<p>
Emily wondered.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, what's Martha living with all those suffragettes
for&mdash;those school-teachers, and doctor women?"
</p>

<p>
And then he said, bitterly: "It's natural she'd prefer them
to&mdash;some people.  Martha's been stung once, and she's afraid.
That's what's the trouble with her."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens!" thought Emily.  "This boy is too wise!
What does he know?  And how does he come to know it?"
</p>

<p>
After a minute she said, "Well, Johnnie, dear, I would like
to see you&mdash;all happy&mdash;and settled down, but I don't know&mdash;that
Martha's the woman for you; and I tell you frankly I think
you ought to stop this loafing about."
</p>

<p>
"I'll ask Mr. Kenworthy for a steady job for a month, if
you want me to."
</p>

<p>
"That's not good enough for you, Johnnie; you can't work
in a garage.  But it's better than nothing."
</p>

<p>
He stuck to the garage for three weeks, and then he threw
it up and departed abruptly on the spring day that Emily noticed
the first tall white iris blooming.  She was rather out of
patience with him.  But Bob&mdash;an amazing lot of sympathy Bob
had for everything masculine&mdash;he just grinned.
</p>

<p>
"He's in love, the poor devil!" he said, and winked a sort
of familiar grimace across the table at Emily.  It annoyed her.
All he had ever said of Martha was: "Well, if she's in love,
she'll have to get over it; that's all."  It gave her almost
satisfaction to get a letter from Martha.
</p>

<p>
"Johnnie's turned up again.  I'm leaving the city for a
holiday.  I'll write you about it next week."
</p>

<p>
Not another word from that child for two weeks.  No sign
of Johnnie; he might at least have had the decency to write
whether or not he had taken to the sea.  And Martha, Emily
planned as the days passed, was going to get a thorough dressing
down when she came back.  Two weeks without writing was a
little too much of a good thing.  Two weeks and five days now,
still no word had come.  Emily was in the garden.  She was,
in fact, exactly at the side of the house which Martha had
suggested adorning with a garage.  She had been digging about
her "bleeding heart" and looking down towards the river,
because she had seen orioles for the first time that morning and
planning what she would say to Martha when she got a chance.
She turned around suddenly to see what car had stopped in front
of the house.  It was a brand-new little blue runabout, and
expensive-looking.
</p>

<p>
And then Johnnie Benton jumped out of it, and turned about
to give a hand to some one&mdash;and Martha Kenworthy jumped
out!  All dressed up in a new suit of rose color, with a lovely
bit of soft fur and a new and nifty hat.  And new shoes and a
new bag&mdash;glorious and smart entirely.  And she had caught
sight of her mother, and came half running up to her.  Johnnie,
too, dressed to kill&mdash;and beaming&mdash;was hurrying to her.  They
were looking at each other.
</p>

<p>
"You two are married!" Emily cried to them; and her heart
sank in a great pity for Johnnie.
</p>

<p>
"Mammie, mammie!" Martha was crying, hugging her.  They
had pulled her into the hall with cries and kisses.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Martha!" Emily murmured.
</p>

<p>
The two were babbling.
</p>

<p>
"What she's wanted all the time, and she's pretending to
scold us.  Look at her, Johnnie."  Martha was laughing at her
mother's consternation.  "We wanted to surprise you.  How
did you <i>know</i>?  I suppose we <i>do</i> look married, maybe."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad," said Emily.
</p>

<p>
"You're <i>not</i>; you're crying!  Didn't we surprise you?  Did
you get my letter?  Rather smooth of me, wasn't it&mdash;'Johnnie's
turned up and I'm leaving the city!'  We'd only been married
an hour when I wrote that, mammie!"
</p>

<p>
She shone, she twinkled, like not one star&mdash;but the whole
canopy of heaven.  She adored her husband with her married
eyes.  She stood the loveliest blossom of the season.  Johnnie
was explaining.  Emily sat breathless looking from one to the
other of them.  "They're utterly married," she thought.  "Martha
isn't pretending.  She isn't putting something across now."  She
couldn't believe it.  But the bridal garments would have
convinced her.  Martha's very stockings were shining bridally.
She had taken off her rosy hat; her frock matched her coat;
she was powdering her nose before the hall glass; she was
cavorting about, and shining.  She called upon her mother to
admire poor Johnnie.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't he a dear?" she chuckled.  "Don't you think he's a
lamb, mammie?"
</p>

<p>
"Cut that out, kiddo!" he cried, enjoying it.
</p>

<p>
"You bring the stuff in, my son.  Mammie, we're going to
open up the room.  But Johnnie can have the little guest
room&mdash;just for his things, can't he?  I told you so, Johnnie.  He's
got to go down and break the news softly to dad.  You go on,
Johnnie; I want to talk to mammie.  But don't you stay more
than half an hour, I tell you.  We're going to turn out that
room, mammie.  I knew it wouldn't be ready.  I'll get out of
my glad rags right away.  Johnnie can help me.  He's good at
housework."
</p>

<p>
The door had finally scarcely closed behind the bridegroom
when Emily cried; "Are you happy, Martie?  Why did you do
this?"
</p>

<p>
Side by side they placed themselves on the sofa instinctively;
and Martha threw her arms about her mother ecstatically.
</p>

<p>
"Am I happy?" she repeated.  "Can't you see I'm happy?
Oh, mammie, I've got so much to tell you.  Oh, ain't I lucky,
mammie?  I didn't know when I married him&mdash;I was just&mdash;mad,
inside&mdash;I was hardboiled.  I didn't intend to be good to
Johnnie.  I didn't know what else to do.  I was sick of being
called an old maid!  I thought he could just run the risk, if
he would keep on asking me.  I didn't intend being nice to him,
or anything.  Mammie, people don't appreciate Johnnie.  I
didn't.  Not at first, and then I found out how SWEET he was!
He was just sweet to me, mammie, and I went and told him
everything the other night.  I could just kiss the ground that
man walks on, with his dear old feet!"
</p>

<p>
Tears came springing into little Mrs. Benton's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I told him everything about New York.  I told him I'd been
crazy.  He said we'd be a pair of nuts, then.  Fifty fifty, he
said, I told him, no, mammie.  A thousand to one, I told
him.  I tried to make him see, but he said I just thought that
because I was such a good little kid!  He said I was a good little
kid, mammie.  Those were his very words!  I tell you right
now, mammie, nobody's ever going to say a word about his
mother to me!  Because she WAS part of him, after all, and he
hates it.  I never knew there was anything in the world so
darling as that man!  You just ought to see him in his
pajamas!  He's too sweet!  Blue and white striped they are.
I'll let you see them, mammie!"
</p>

<p>
"Rare treat," thought Emily, dazedly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think he's a lamb, mammie?  Don't you think he's
too dear?"
</p>

<p>
"I always liked Johnnie."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't mean that way!  You just wait till you know
him better!  But nobody can appreciate Johnnie till she's
married to him!"
</p>

<p>
"That seems too bad!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know.  It suits me!" she retorted, immediately.
"Nobody wants a lot of women sitting around appreciating her
husband.  Mammie, it was too funny the way it happened.  You
know, Mrs. Blacksley and I had an awful row.  She practically
put me out of the shop."
</p>

<p>
"Oh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she did.  It was too funny, when you think about it.
You see&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She chuckled.  She could enjoy any joke herself in her high
mood.  "She had to have some money to go on with, and she
asked me straight out if there was any chance of me putting
some in.  And I said no, not unless she got rid of that man of
hers.  Mother, you can't imagine what a temper that woman's
got!  I thought she was going to pull my hair or slap me.  I
kept backing out towards the door, and she kept coming after
me.  She called me&mdash;&mdash;"  Martha giggled.  "She called me an
evil-minded little old maid!  She said she'd like to see me
groveling&mdash;groveling, it was she said&mdash;before some man.  And
here I am already just groveling!  She said she hoped I'd have
enough sense some day to appreciate a real man.  It was pretty
rotten of me to say that to her, because she is fond of him.
She said his very cough was precious to her; she said she hoped
I'd fall in love till I'd kiss somebody's false teeth when he
wasn't there himself!"  Martha snickered and added, "But, of
course, he'd take them with him, his teeth, but I didn't think of
that in time to answer her.  I was afraid of her.  And I was
mad, I can tell you.  And then, of course, Johnnie came along
again.  I was hardboiled and I went and married him.
Because, after all, you've got to marry or be called an old maid
in this world, haven't you, mammie?  Let's ask her down now
after a while, for a week.  Mrs. Blacksley, I mean.  But maybe
she won't come.  She's got such an awful temper."
</p>

<p>
Emily cried, the moment there was a pause&mdash;suddenly:
</p>

<p>
"Martha, I was never unfaithful to your father in my
life&mdash;your father, I mean Bob Kenworthy!"
</p>

<p>
"You weren't?"  She stared at her mother, taken aback.
"Well, that's sort of funny."
</p>

<p>
"I ought to have told you that at once that day when you
told me&mdash;what you thought!  But I didn't."
</p>

<p>
Martha was looking at her thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's sort of funny.  I was just thinking of that this
morning!" She had spoken slowly, but a thought quickened her
pace again.  "Mammie, you just ought to see Johnnie in the
morning!  He's too sweet!  His hair never gets mussed up a
bit, it's so short, and sort of soft in the morning.  And I was
just thinking this morning about what you said, or what I said
to you, rather, and it would have been a raw deal for dad,
after all.  Because really, if a woman's got a good husband,
she ought to treat him right, I think.  Don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I CERTAINLY DO!"
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't want anybody treating Johnnie that way, I know
that."  And her tongue wagged happily on.  Mother's vices
or virtues were dismissed as slight things, in this new joy.  They
sat still there, Emily listening to Johnnie's praises till he came
back into the room with Bob.
</p>

<p>
The paternal blessing detained them only for a minute.  They
hurried away to their housekeeping.  A hurricane of happiness;
seemed to be moving the furniture in the painted room about,
judging from the noise.  Bob and Emily sat side by side
listening to the chortles of mirth that came down to them.  Bob
couldn't stop grinning.
</p>

<p>
"I always said this would happen, Emily.  I always knew it
would."
</p>

<p>
"Right as usual!" said Emily.  If a woman has a good husband,
what's the use of reminding him of all he doesn't know? she
mused, happily.
</p>

<p>
She scarcely knew the painted room itself when she went up
to it later.  It was noon, but the curtains were pushed back as
far as possible, and the blinds rolled to the top, so that the
sunshine came crashing down like thunder from paradise on the
roused and choral colors.  The Victrola was grinding out:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Two for tea,<br>
  And tea for two.<br>
  A girl for me,<br>
  And a boy for you.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Johnnie cried out, "Come in, Mrs. Kenworthy!"
</p>

<p>
Martha gurgled, jeering.  "Mrs. Kenworthy! the nerve of
you!  Call her mother!"
</p>

<p>
They hadn't ceased dancing.  Martha had a gaudy printed
purple silk thing, a man's belongings, pinned about her head,
turban-wise, and her arms were clasped firmly around her
husband's waist.  She made a gesture with her head about the
room.
</p>

<p>
"It never looked better, did it, mammie?  You always wanted
it this way."
</p>

<p>
The beds were standing together, at length, where they had
always belonged.
</p>

<p>
"I just let Johnnie arrange everything else to suit himself,"
she said.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
